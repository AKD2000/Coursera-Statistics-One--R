1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,916
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:09,520
We're in lecture ten, and the topic of the
lecture today is, Confidence Intervals.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,800
In the first segment, I introduce the idea

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,660
of Confidence Intervals, in the context of
sample means.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,199
In this section, we'll look at Confidence
Intervals, around regression coefficients.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:31,100
So, again, a Confidence interval can be
applied to any sample statistic.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,360
So this segment, is actually very
repetitive of the last segment.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,330
A lot of the concepts are the same, I'm
just going to

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,380
apply those concepts, to a regression
coefficient, rather than a sample mean.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,840
For some reason, in actual reporting of
statistics a lot,

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,270
as I said in the last segment, a lot

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,380
of researchers are sort of uneasy about
reporting Confidence intervals.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,580
Partly because they're so large.

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,080
but worse than that, is there rarely

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,080
applied to things like correlation or
regression coefficients.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,188
For some reason people understand that
there's a, there's

17
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:14,928
variability around a mean, but they there,
there less prone

18
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:20,050
to apply that same logic to a correlation
or regression coefficient.

19
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,190
So remember, a correlation coefficient or

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,710
regression coefficient, they too are
sample statistics.

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,760
So they too are just point estimates, and
it

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,960
would be better if we were reporting
interval estimates.

23
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,800
So again, this all is the same as what I
said for a sample mean.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,110
we have a

25
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,405
regression coefficient.

26
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,850
iI that's just from one sample, it's a
point estimate.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,235
what that means, is it represent just

28
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:51,130
one point in this possible sampling
distribution.

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,570
So remember, from regression, we can get a
t value, and r gives you that,

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,550
because it gives you a t value and then a
p value associated with it.

31
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,920
and the t value was the,

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,480
just the unstandardized regression
coefficient, B over

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,520
the standard error.

34
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,012
And again, that's just going to fall some
where in a sampling distribution.

35
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:17,810
So again, it's going to be some point in a
sampling distribution.

36
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,680
If it was there, we would say it's not
significant.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:20,960
Right?

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,890
Cause its not very extreme, but if it was
like way out here,

39
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,410
or way out here, then the probability of
landing there, is very low,

40
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,050
under the assumption that the mean is
zero, then we would reject the null.

41
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,340
Again, this is the same as I said in the
last segment, the

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,250
logic here is to report a range of values,
rather than a single value.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,690
Report an interval estimate, rather than a
point estimate.

44
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,360
And again the argument for this, is the
reality of sampling error.

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,180
If we know that we have a large

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,105
population, and we're only getting a very
small

47
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:01,430
[SOUND],

48
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,010
even if it's representative, we're getting
a small sample, then we're going

49
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,180
have some degree of sampling error, and we
have to acknowledge that.

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,130
And one way to acknowledge that, is rather
than report a point

51
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,120
estimate, just report the interval
estimate,

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,380
that takes into account standard error.

53
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,890
Again, this is the main point from the
last segment,

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,920
and it's the take home message from the
entire lecture.

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,290
The confidence intervals are going to be
influenced by, the width of them, will be

56
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,540
influenced by standard error, which is
influenced

57
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,190
by sample size, and variance in the
population.

58
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,599
So again, let's go to the, back to this
impact example.

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,340
what I'm going to do, is run a regression

60
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,620
predicting visual memory score, from
verbal memory score.

61
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,660
And I use these two variables, because
they showed a really

62
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,490
nice degree of correlation, if you
remember in our overall sample.

63
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,762
I think the correlation was in the range
of like, point 4 something.

64
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:04,592
so we should

65
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:08,991
get a nice prediction, and a significant
regression

66
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:14,456
coefficient, if we were doing Null
hypothesis significance testing.

67
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:17,810
what we can do is get an interval around
that.

68
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,020
And again, just like I did in the last
segment, we'll do it for two different

69
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,280
sample sizes, so we see how the interval

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,490
gets wider, as we decrease the sample
size.

71
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,880
So we'll start with a sample size of 40.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,080
And here's what the the regression looks
like.

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,540
So I'm just plotting the scatter plot with
the

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,600
regression lines, so that's the actual
slope that I got.

75
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,690
That's the point estimate, is the blue
line.

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,480
That's the slope relating verbal memory,
to visual memory.

77
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,300
So that's B in the regression coefficient.

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,930
But that's just one number, that's a point
estimate.

79
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,540
If I want to get the confidence interval,
well I got that out of r.

80
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,610
And then what I did, is I just plugged it
into the scatter plot.

81
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,930
And that's what you see in the shadow,
around the regression coefficient.

82
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,170
So what this shows me,

83
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:22,990
is the possible range of regression lines,
that I could expect due to chance.

84
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,670
So how this works, is I could get one, let
me erase that.

85
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,030
So the regression line could be as steep
as if I start at the very bottom

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,080
of this shaded area, it could be as steep,
as this.

87
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,160
So that's the upper bound of the
Confidence interval, so

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,120
that slope would be the upper bound in our
Confidence interval.

89
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,950
Or it could be a shallow, if I start form
here and go to here, it could be

90
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,900
as shallow as that.

91
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,050
Notice that, that's still a positive
slope.

92
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,580
So in this shaded region, I don't have

93
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,710
a flat line, and I don't have any negative
slopes.

94
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,130
So you can interpret from this visual,
this graphic, with this regression

95
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:20,320
line, and this 95% Confidence interval
around it, you could interpret this to be

96
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,150
a significant relationship between verbal
memory, and visual memory.

97
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,370
Again, hardcore statisticians would argue,
you're reporting Confidence

98
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,810
intervals to get away from the idea of
statistical significance and NHST.

99
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,670
but those of us who are so prone, and it's

100
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,435
such a habit to think, is it significant
or not?

101
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:47,790
Would look at this and see well, I can't
get

102
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,810
a flat regression line in there, in this
shadowed region.

103
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,180
That means it's a significant effect.

104
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,120
so that's sort of a, a, an argument
against Confidence intervals,

105
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,100
is when you report them like this, and you
report a

106
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,350
visual even if you report the interval,
and if zero is

107
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,660
not in the interval, then you can assume
or you can infer.

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,820
Excuse me.

109
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,950
you can infer that it's statistically
significant.

110
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,480
so even with Confidence intervals, you can
still sort

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,260
of run into this problem of the idea of
significance.

112
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,360
But let's look at the interval and the
width

113
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,860
of the shaded region, as we decrease
sample size.

114
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,710
So now, again, I use the impact data, but
now I just got a random sample

115
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,730
of 20.

116
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,060
Same exact variables, same exact
regression, so

117
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,304
it's still LM, visual memory tilde verbal
memory.

118
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:48,098
and now look what it looks like.

119
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:51,720
We have a, a regression line that's
similar

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,440
to the last example, because that's my
point estimate.

121
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,770
But the shaded region around it is

122
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,040
much larger, because the standard error
went up.

123
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,930
Why did the standard

124
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,540
error go up?
Because n went down.

125
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,000
So now, you see that I can put a flat line
in there.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,615
I could just go

127
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,130
[SOUND].

128
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,810
So, it's possible that the true population
parameter for B,

129
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,720
is 0.
If that's possible, then you would get a

130
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,790
non significant p value if you were doing
NHST.

131
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:31,660
but the bigger point here, is to show how
wide that

132
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,680
interval is in the scatter plot, when
sample size went down.

133
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,240
The other point to take away, is you
really should be doing this

134
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,290
any time you report a scatter plot,
correlation or a regression.

135
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,220
If you, If you're showing a scatter plot,
it's really nice to

136
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,130
put that that confidence interval, or at
least the standard error around it.

137
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,810
Again, to indicate and to acknowledge,
that you

138
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,840
have just a point estimate, you have just

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,410
one sample, and you have some degree of
sampling error.

140
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,870
How much sampling error?

141
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,590
Well that's reflected in the width of the

142
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,750
shaded region, which is driven again, by
standard error.

143
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,360
So it's really nice to put those in there,
we'll do that in the lab.

144
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,140
And we'll, we'll give you script, that
shows you how to generate a

145
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,810
scatter plot with this shaded region

146
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,940
in reflecting standard error, or
Confidence interval.

147
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,740
So again, to wrap up this segment, it's
the same summary as the first segment.

148
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,680
It's, this very important point that all
sample statistics.

149
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,040
Not just means, but correlation
coefficients, regression coefficients.

150
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,070
Anything else you take away from one
sample.

151
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,200
They're just point estimates.

152
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,890
And that means, they just reflect one

153
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,120
point on this idea of a sampling
distribution.

154
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,710
So the logic of Confidence intervals, is
to report

155
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,690
a range of values rather than just a
point.

156
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,670
So we report an interval estimate, not a
point estimate.

157
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,310
And finally, the width of the Confidence

158
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,630
interval, is just going to depend on
standard error.

159
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,640
And standard error depends on sample size,
and variance in the population.
