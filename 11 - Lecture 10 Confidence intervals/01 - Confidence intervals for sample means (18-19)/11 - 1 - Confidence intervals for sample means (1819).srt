1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,340
Hi, welcome back to Statistics One.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,910
We're up to Lecture 10, and the topic in
Lecture 10 is confidence intervals.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,680
Last week we talked a lot about null
hypothesis significance testing.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,270
And we talked about some of the problems
inherent in NHST.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,440
And a lot of the criticisms of the entire
approach of NHST.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,040
So in this lecture, we'll talk about an
entirely different approach

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,340
which is just to report confidence
intervals around sample

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,470
statistics, rather than engage in
inferential statistics per se.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,640
Let me explain what I mean.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,330
So in this lecture I'll divide the, the
topic

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,250
of confidence intervals for now into just
two segments.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,820
In the first segment I'll talk about

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,530
confidence intervals around sample means,
and then

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,480
hopefully reinforce the idea of confidence
intervals

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,700
by talking about confidence intervals
around regression coefficients.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,390
Since we've spent a good bit of time

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,050
on regression and, and again in the next
lecture

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,010
we be talking about multiple regression so
this

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,410
should be fresh in your minds at this
point.

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,930
So lets launch into the first segment.

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,383
Here we'll just talk about Confidence
intervals around sample means.

22
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:22,594
This is sort of the easiest and most

23
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:26,399
obvious place to start when talking about
confidence intervals.

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,490
Now, what do I mean by a confidence
interval?

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,180
Well, remember that all sample statistics
be

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,570
it a mean, a correlation, a regression
coefficient.

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,230
Whatever sample statistic we take are

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,640
simply what statisticians would call point
estimates.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,840
That is, they're just one point in an
entire possible

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,430
sampling distribution.

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,060
Remember the whole idea of sampling error,
and sampling

32
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,360
distributions and the concept of the
central limit theorem.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,220
What that implies is any one sample will
never be

34
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,000
perfect if we're only getting a random
sample from a population.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,440
So the statistical phrase for that is we

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,010
can only get a point estimate from a
sample.

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,390
So if we think about sampling
distributions,

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,620
remember this was the family of tea
distributions.

39
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,780
These are all sampling distributions.

40
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,750
They vary slightly, remember, due to
sample size.

41
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,360
So these degrees of freedom, that's just n
minus one in the simplest case.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,250
You can think of that as sample size.

43
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,620
But each of these are sampling
distributions.

44
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,040
And when we get a sample mean From a

45
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,720
distribution we just fall somewhere in
that sampling distribution.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,420
We're one point in that sampling
distribution.

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,710
That's the point of a sample mean or any
sample statistic.

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,680
It's just one point in this entire

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,430
possible Range of values this entire
distribution.

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,400
So, the logic of confidence intervals,
which statisticians really approve of.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,320
They, it's, a statistician would always

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,540
recommend, always report your confidence
intervals.

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,170
Those of us who are more applied, we tend
not to do it and you will see one of the

54
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,735
reasons why is they are so wide.
One author called it embarrassingly large.

55
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:36,550
[LAUGH]

56
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,760
The point estimates just seem more
accurate because of an illusion.

57
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,510
Again, the logic of the confidence
intervals is to report

58
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,190
a range of values, rather than just a
single value.

59
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,350
So there are, rather than just report the
sample

60
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,870
mean, report a range, a possible range of
value.

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,250
And we'll call that an interval estimate,
rather than a point estimate.

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,670
So, to be clear, a confidence interval is
an interval

63
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,150
estimate of a population parameter based
on one random sample.

64
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,668
The degree of confidence, how confident we
want to be in this interval.

65
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,890
For example, 95%, that's one of

66
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,750
the most common confidence intervals
that's reported.

67
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,400
When we do this in lab and we do this in
the R software,

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,370
that's the default confidence interval is
95%.

69
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,230
that represents the probability that the

70
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,010
interval will capture the true population
parameter.

71
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,330
Okay, so this is the formal definition of
confidence interval.

72
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,700
And again, the main argument for interval

73
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,900
estimates is the reality of sampling
error.

74
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,160
We know that we have sampling error, so
let's just be upfront about that.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,520
We, when we, if we're just reporting a

76
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,160
point estimate than we could be fooling
ourselves.

77
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,480
Worse yet we could be fooling our
audience, our readers.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,980
So why not report the interval and just
acknowledge the fact

79
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,680
that we have sampling error?

80
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,130
Sampling error, remember, implies that
every point estimate, any one

81
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,640
point estimate, is going to be off by some
degree.

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,990
How much is it going to be off?

83
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,480
Well, that Has to do with how much
sampling error we can expect.

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,120
And that, we estimate, remember was
standard error.

85
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,210
So, the bottom line here, this is where
the phrase confidence

86
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,390
interval comes from, is researchers will
be more confident, or

87
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,540
should be more confident in the accuracy
of what they're reporting.

88
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,310
If they report an interval estimate rather
than a point estimate.

89
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,140
So let's get back to the specific topic of
confidence intervals for a sample mean.

90
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,760
And again I'm going to use the example of
the impact data.

91
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,490
We've used these a few times so I thought

92
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,070
I'd use this again to, to illustrate
confidence intervals.

93
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,360
let's assume we took just random samples

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,530
of only 30 athletes from those impact
data.

95
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,450
Remember, we had more than that, but let's
assume

96
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,350
that we just took random samples of 30,
and we repeated

97
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,020
that random sampling process and we would
get a sampling distribution, right?

98
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,270
We don't actually do that, we just get one
sample.

99
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,260
but let's assume we did it multiple times.

100
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,600
Here I'm just showing you actually I did
it to prepare this lecture I, I did it and

101
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,830
now I just randomly sampled samples of 30,
and I got the symptoms score at baseline.

102
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,390
Remember symptoms score at baseline should

103
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,220
be zero, because these are healthy
athletes.

104
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,180
Not everybody is at zero some athletes
come

105
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,820
in at baseline and then might reveal some
symptoms.

106
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,450
so the mean isn't exactly zero.

107
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,990
And if I get repeated random samples of
size 30 then the means

108
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,830
not going to be exactly the same each time
because of sampling error.

109
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,370
So, the first time I did it I got a mean
of 0.05 then I got 0.07 then I got 0.03.

110
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,090
So, it's close to zero.

111
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,510
There's not a lot of fluctuation beacuase
my sample size is not

112
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,830
bad considering there's not much variance
in this, in this variable at baseline.

113
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,160
Now let's decrease the sample size to ten,
and do it again.

114
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,120
So now I've decreased the sample size to
ten, I get symptom score at baseline.

115
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,022
Again the mean is going to be near zero
because these athletes are healthy,

116
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:47,581
but notice I got 0.01, I got a 0.2 in
there, and a 00.

117
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:54,550
So now there's more fluctuation in my
point estimates, in my sample means.

118
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,920
As I do that over and over again.

119
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,450
Now let's look at symptom score post
injury.

120
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,170
Now the mean isn't, shouldn't be zero

121
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,224
anymore because these athletes have been
concussed.

122
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:09,921
they're going to show a lot of symptoms.

123
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,140
So first let's do it again with N equals
30.

124
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,141
I got a few random samples.

125
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,491
I got a mean of 12 point 03.
Then I got a mean of 12 point 9.

126
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:24,102
Then I got a mean of 14 point 13.
So a little bit of fluctuation.

127
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:29,180
Again, that's just due to chance.
That's sampling error.

128
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,260
But let's decrease our N to 10 and do it
again.

129
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,160
Now these are athletes post injury, but
smaller sample, random samples of 10.

130
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,460
I got 19.7 and then only 8, and then 13.3.
And again,

131
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,780
you get more fluctuation.
with the lower N because there's more

132
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,230
sampling error when we have a smaller
sample size.

133
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,570
The other thing to notice is we get more
fluctuation in the post-injury scores than

134
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,588
in the base lines scores because there's
more variability post-injury.

135
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,926
Right?

136
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,930
So, the point of that little exercise is
the width

137
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,690
of a confidence interval is going to
depend on two things.

138
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,160
Sample

139
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,240
size.

140
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,390
So a sample size goes up my, the width of
the interval is

141
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,200
going to get tighter because I'm going to
be more confident about my estimate.

142
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,310
Right?

143
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,060
The other thing that will influence the

144
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,210
width is the variance in the population,
and

145
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,170
therefore the variance in the sample if
we're

146
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,020
getting a random representative sample
from the population.

147
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,970
So more variability in the sample means
more

148
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,310
very, very or wider width in that, in that
confidence interval.

149
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,580
All that is to say is standard error

150
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,360
is going to drive the width of the
confidence interval,

151
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,640
because remember standard error is the
standard deviation

152
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,260
of the sample over the square root of M.

153
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,710
Remember, that's where if we could jack up
N

154
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,250
and get really big samples, we get really
little

155
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,230
standard error.

156
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,410
Because standard error is how much
sampling error would I

157
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,900
expect just due to chance on average,
that's standard error.

158
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,890
So I ran this in r, and you'll be doing
this in lab, so with the sample size of

159
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:30,130
30, and using symptom score as my
variable, the 95% confidence

160
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:37,300
interval at baseline was negative 03 to
just.

161
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,641
1 .

162
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,510
So right around zero.

163
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,050
Notice it goes below zero which doesn't
make any sense,

164
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,620
that's not a possible score on the symptom
score.

165
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,440
But what it does is you will see the
calculation in a moment, it just

166
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,980
calculates the mean of the sample times
standard

167
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,720
error and time some function of standard
error.

168
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,290
So it might go below zero if the true
score is zero

169
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,777
but notice how type that is it's, it's not
a very wide interval.

170
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:14,380
I have 95% confidence that the true score
is somewhere in there, and it should be.

171
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,730
The true score should be zero or very
close to

172
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,680
zero, because these are healthy athletes,
they're taking this at baseline.

173
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,540
so it's right around zero, it's a very
tight interval.

174
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,880
If I go down to a sample size of 10,
again,

175
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,380
I just ran this in R to see what I would
get.

176
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,030
now I'm going a little bit even further
below zero, which is weird.

177
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,960
but now I"m up to 0.5.

178
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,290
Again it's, it's right around zero.

179
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,890
That's because there's not much
variability in this variable at baseline.

180
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,060
But you see how the width of the

181
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,890
confidence interval gets wider as sample
size goes down.

182
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,430
That's because we have more standard
error.

183
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,980
When sample size is lower.

184
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,690
Now this is more interesting.
Let's look at symptoms score after the

185
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,380
injury.
again let's start with sample size of 30.

186
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:12,520
Again I just random in R with a random
sample of 30 and

187
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,430
here is my 95% confidence interval It's
7.5 to 18.3.

188
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:24,010
So, that's a pretty wide range.
And I have a sample size

189
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,940
of 30.

190
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,220
it seemed much more accurate before,
right?

191
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,800
When we just reported the point estimate.

192
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,640
We just said, well, the average symptom
score is say, 12.

193
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,210
You know, then that would be, through like
a

194
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,790
walk away, alright, this is how serious
the injury is.

195
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,880
They have about a 12 on the symptom score.

196
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,010
But again, that's a point estimate just
from one sample and

197
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,240
there's some degree of sampling error
associated with any one individual sample.

198
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,590
So it would be more honest and more
accurate, and I could be more

199
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,050
confident in my reporting, if I reported

200
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,660
this interval estimate, rather than a
point estimate.

201
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,050
But, I would have to show just how wide

202
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,814
the interval is, and here it's 7.5 to
18.3.

203
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,160
It gets worse as sample size goes down of
course.

204
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,100
So, now let's look at it with an N of 10.

205
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,350
Now, let's look at the 95% confidence
interval, 2.7 to 23.9.

206
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,200
It's basically saying with an N of 10 I

207
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,255
don't know where you're going to fall on
this thing.

208
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:40,480
2.7 is closed to zero, that's close to
showing no symptoms at all,

209
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,280
and 23.9 is almost off the charts on this
scale.

210
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,200
so with a sample size of 10 if you

211
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,060
want 95% confidence that your capturing
the true population parameters.

212
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,730
you're going to have to report a really
wide interval.

213
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,940
And again this is why I think most
researchers

214
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,530
don't actually do 95% confidence
intervals, because as I

215
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,920
said, as one author called them,
embarrassingly large.

216
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,740
This is a good example of one that's
embarrassingly large.

217
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,590
So how did R actually calculate those
confidence intervals?

218
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,170
Where it should be sort of intuitive to
you by now that what we

219
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,305
do is just take the sample mean, because
remember we only have one actual sample.

220
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:29,560
We take that sample mean and to get the

221
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,840
upper bound of the interval, we're
going to add standard error.

222
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,600
Because a standard go, standard error goes
up, we want to, we want to increase

223
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,220
the width of it.

224
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:46,160
but we want to multiply that by a t value,
which we get from the t distribution.

225
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,730
And then to get the lower bound, we do

226
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,350
the same thing, except we subtract t times
standard error.

227
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,040
Where standard error is still just
standard error, the standard

228
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,162
deviation of the sample over the square
root of M.

229
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:05,260
This T statistic it just depends on the
level of confidence desired so

230
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,655
for now lets stick with 95% confidence
levels and

231
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:13,450
that corresponds to a alpha of point 05,
that idea.

232
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,820
You need p less than.

233
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,360
05 to reject the null hypothesis, that's
why 95%

234
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,760
confidence intervals are sort of the
standard, because alpha of.

235
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,960
05 is also the standard.

236
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,180
So that t, the actual t value that gets
plugged into this formula,

237
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:37,080
depends on the level of confidence
desired, say 95%, and sample size.

238
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,720
Why sample size well, because again, the
sampling

239
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,710
distribution that we assume, depends on,
the exact

240
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,700
size of your sample, where the width of

241
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,290
the sampling distribution, gets a little
bit wider.

242
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,580
With smaller samples, right?
Smaller samples are going to give me more

243
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,860
standard error, so if I want 95% of that
distribution,

244
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,600
then I'm going to have to go little bit
further out.

245
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,260
I'm going to need a slightly higher T
value.

246
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,470
So that's why it depends on both standard
error and the T value.

247
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,390
So to wrap up this segment, remember that

248
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,700
all sample statistics, and this is a
critical

249
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,410
thing to remember as a consumer of
statistics,

250
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,330
that any one sample is just a point
estimate.

251
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,550
And now that we know about this idea of
sampling error, we know that

252
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,790
there exists out there in the world

253
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,410
this, this hypothetical idea of a sampling
distribution.

254
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,200
So you should know

255
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,180
that any one sample is just a point
estimate in that possible

256
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,290
sampling distribution.
so this any one sample mean

257
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:55,140
is just represents one point, and a larger
distribution.

258
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,800
So the logic of confidence intervals is to
report a range of

259
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,650
values, rather than just a single value,
and in statistics that's called reporting

260
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,520
an interval estimate rather than a point
estimate.

261
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,200
And, perhaps most importantly, just know
that the

262
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,840
width of the confidence interval, what
influences that?

263
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,030
Well, standard error.

264
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,270
And what influences standard error?

265
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,370
Sample size and variance in the
population.

266
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,320
And that hopefully now conceptually rings
true to you.

267
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,940
But also mathematically should make sense
to you, because

268
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,730
we've dealt with this formula a few times
now.

269
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,130
So standard error is standard deviation
over the square root of N.

270
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,560
So as variance in the population goes up,
standard deviation in

271
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,210
my sample should go up if I'm getting a
good estimate.

272
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,740
So it's standard deviation goes up,
standard air goes up.

273
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,020
And as I've said repeatedly now if sample
size

274
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,750
goes up then the denominator of standard
air goes up,

275
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,620
standard air is going to go down.

276
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,100
Okay, so the width is going to depend on

277
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
those two elements, and put together just
standard error.
