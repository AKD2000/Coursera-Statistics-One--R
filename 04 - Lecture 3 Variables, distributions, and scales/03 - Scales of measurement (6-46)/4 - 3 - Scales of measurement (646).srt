00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,010
Hi, welcome back.
Rep to lecture 3, segment 3.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,920
And this last segment of lecture three is
on scales of measurement.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,564
Now, in lecture three, I have sort of been
em, emphasizing how

4
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:20,260
important it is to know what type of
variable you are dealing with.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,532
And emphasizing how important it is to

6
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:25,880
look at your distributions in your
variables.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,355
It's also really important to keep in mind
what scale

8
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:31,168
of measurement you're dealing with.

9
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:33,090
so this last segment, which will be a

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,390
slightly shorter segment, is just talking
about different scales.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,840
We've already dealt with this in the last

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,420
segment by looking at the body temperature
example.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,500
So, for all those histograms, I presented
the

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,070
histograms first in degrees Fahrenheit,
then in degrees Celsius.

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,736
Those are just two different scales of
measurement

16
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:55,680
to measure temperature.
Alright?

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,450
So, I think we're all used to dealing with
scales of measurement.

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,242
But in statistics, what's nice is there's
a

19
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:08,620
standard scale and it's called the Z
scale.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:17,670
So, any score from any scale can be
converted into a Z scale with Z scores.

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,001
And this allows for a really efficient
communication across stataticians.

22
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:26,838
scientists can share data, different
researchers can share data.

23
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:27,706
If everything is

24
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:30,610
converted to a Z scale, it's very easy to
interpret.

25
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,990
And it's very simple calculation.

26
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,080
How do we convert a, what I'll call a raw
score to a Z score?

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,870
It's just this formula right here.

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,792
We just take the raw score, that's x,
subtract

29
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:51,785
the mean m, and divide by the standard
deviation.

30
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:55,800
Now, we haven't covered summary statistics
in detail yet.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,348
We'll do that in the next lecture, so
you'll see exactly how

32
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:00,161
to calculate mean and standard deviation
if

33
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,954
you're not familiar that, with that
already.

34
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:03,850
but that's it.

35
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,940
It's that simple a calculation.

36
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,361
So we'll just take the raw score,

37
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,020
subtract the mean, divide by the standard
deviation.

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,820
That gives us a Z score.

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,016
And if we do that for every score in a
distribution, then

40
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:18,730
we can put our distribution on this common
metric, the Z scale.

41
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,216
So, what's also nice about a Z scale or Z
scores, is the

42
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:30,690
mean Z score in any one sample is always
going to be 0.

43
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,660
Right?

44
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,740
So I take the raw score, subtract the
mean.

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,980
If my raw score is the mean, so say

46
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,280
body temperature, the average body
temperature in Fahrenheit is 98.6.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,308
So 98.6 minus the mean, assuming a normal
distribution,

48
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:52,440
98.6 minus 98.6 be 0, divided by whatever
the standard deviation is, would be 0.

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,860
So the mean in any Z score distribution is
going to be 0.

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,320
What's nice about that is if you have a
negative Z

51
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,450
score, then I know you have, your score is
below average.

52
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,360
And if you have a positive Z score, then I
know you're above average.

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,550
So again, let's look at this body
temperature distribution.

54
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,937
Here it is again in, in

55
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:17,650
degrees Fahrenheit, it's this nice normal
distribution.

56
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,580
Here it is again in Celsius, again nice
normal distribution.

57
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,378
Here it is in terms of z scores.
Again, we did this in r, and r sort of did

58
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:34,120
the breaks a little bit differently for
this graph, but it's still a nice

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,544
normal distribution.
And most importantly, the average is 0.

60
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:45,928
So the average body temperature in terms
of z scores is 0.

61
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:49,750
These are the same exact numbers from
histogram to histogram, to histogram.

62
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,540
It's just in degrees Fahrenheit, degrees
Celsius, or in Z-scores.

63
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,320
It's the same exact numbers.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,610
We just converted them, direct conversion.

65
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,699
So, just to be clear, let's assume we have

66
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,780
a normal distribution of healthy
individuals, where the mean

67
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,246
body temperature is 98.6 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the standard

68
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:15,339
deviation is about a half a degree, so
0.5.

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,560
Suppose I pick one individual from that
distribution at random,

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,656
and that individual's body temperature is
99.6 degrees.

71
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:31,561
Now, I want to convert that raw score,
that X 99.6

72
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:36,670
to a Z score.
Well, all I have to do is apply this Z

73
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,682
formula.
I take the raw score, 99.6,

74
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:46,722
subtract out the mean, 98.6, divide by the
standard deviation,

75
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:51,940
which was 0.5.
So that's just one over 0.5, or 2.

76
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,082
So this individual's Z-score is positive
2.

77
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:58,610
There are two standard deviations above
the mean.

78
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,115
The other thing we can do once we convert
everything to Z scores and

79
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:11,480
look at histograms in a Z distribution, is
we can easily get percentile rank.

80
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,693
Which is a useful statistic to get when
we're looking at

81
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,465
descriptive statistics and where
individuals fall

82
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,850
relative to others within a distribution.

83
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,832
So the percentile rank is just the
percentage of scores

84
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:28,800
that fall at or below that score in a
distribution.

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,044
So, if we're dealing with a perfectly
normal distribution and we've converted

86
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:39,460
everything to Z scores, then I know that
the percentile rank for a Z of 0 is 50%.

87
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,380
Right?

88
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,008
If I have a nice normal distribution,
normal distribution,

89
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:49,260
I've converted it to Z, so the mean is 0.

90
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,770
Then below that score is going to be 50%
of the distribution.

91
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:03,572
In other words, the percentile rank of a Z
of 0 or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is 50%.

92
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,020
50% of the distribution falls below the
mean.

93
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,060
So, to sum up, the Z-scale is the standard
scale that we use in statistics.

94
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,190
It's very efficient.

95
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,956
It's very nice for communication.

96
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:22,600
I can take any raw score, convert it to a
Z-score.

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,650
And once I have a Z-score, I can get a
percentile rank.

98
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,890
So these conversions are very common in
statistics.

99
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,540
And at this point, you should

100
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,560
be comfortable doing those types of
conversions.

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,408
And we'll do those in lab and

102
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:40,280
perhaps on a, on the next homework.
And that's the end of this segment.
