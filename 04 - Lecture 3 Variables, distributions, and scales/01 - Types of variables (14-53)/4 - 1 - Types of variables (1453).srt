1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,790
Hey, welcome back.
We're up to Lecture Three.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,160
In lecture three, we'll be talking about
Variables, Distribution and Scales.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,045
And as you can tell from the title of

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:16,435
the lecture, this lecture is divided into
three segments.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,009
In this first segment we'll talk about
types of variables.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,526
It's very important at the outset of the
course, to understand what type

7
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:29,702
of variable that you're dealing with

8
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:34,070
when you're conducting a particular
statistical analysis.

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,209
So we'll be careful here to explicitly
define different types of variables.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,655
So first, what is a variable?
Well, a variable is anything

11
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:48,137
that can take on multiple values, in
contrast to a constant that

12
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:52,412
only takes on one value.
So comparing variables and

13
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:57,050
constants you might say, is like comparing
apples and gravity.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,384
So, there's apples and gravity, apples,
the size, the

15
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:09,050
shape, the weight even the type of apple,
those are all variables.

16
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,360
There are lots of different types of
apples, they

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,850
take different sizes, different shapes,
different weights and so on.

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,010
Those are all variable.

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,170
In contrast, gravity or gravitational
force is a constant on Earth.

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:32,940
In statistics, it's common to classify
variables into four distinct kinds.

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,760
And I'm going to follow suit with that
tradition.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,310
And the four kinds are nominal, ordinal,
interval, and ratio.

23
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,260
You might think, where did these four
kinds come from?

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,760
They come from, classic cognitive
psychologist, S.S. Stevens.

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,103
And this is a classic

26
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:54,685
paper published in Science in 1946, where
he outlay, outlined

27
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:59,510
these four types of variables are four
types of measurements.

28
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,620
So lets start with the simplest type of
variable, a nominal variable.

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,828
A nominal variable and it, it literally
means to name types, of,

30
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:15,850
of, instances of, of variables, is to just
assign individual

31
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,910
cases, two categories.

32
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,708
So for example the Coursera students that
are out there that are watching

33
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:29,780
statistic one, statistics one they come
from countries all over the world.

34
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,030
So your country of origin is a nominal
variable.

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,690
It's just assigning individuals to
categories.

36
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,390
So country of origin, is a nominal
variable.

37
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,450
It just allows me to distinguish some
students from others.

38
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,150
So there are some students from Brazil,
some students from

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,000
Argentina, some from Australia, India, the
US and so on.

40
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,630
The next type of variable is an ordinal
variable.

41
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,340
Ordinal variables are used to rank order
cases in a data structure.

42
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,583
So, again, if we think about the countries
where all of

43
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:15,758
our students are coming from in this
Statistics one course on Coursera.

44
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:21,840
I might rank the, the countries according
to population.

45
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,493
So some countries like

46
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:29,583
China, India have much larger populations
than smaller countries say like France

47
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:35,840
or a really small country say like
Luxembourg, have smaller populations.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,668
And if I just wanted to rank order them,
in terms of who has the highest

49
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,110
population, they get a number one, who has

50
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,171
the second highest population they get a
number two.

51
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:49,059
Then, ranking would

52
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:55,207
be an ordinal variable.
Interval variables are

53
00:03:55,207 --> 00:04:01,490
also used to rank order cases, so we can,
we can order cases from top to bottom.

54
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:08,290
but, in this case, the distance, or
interval, between each value is equal.

55
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,140
That's why it's called an interval
variable.

56
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,420
So again, sticking with this theme of
countries

57
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,260
of origin for Coursera students each
country, if we

58
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,530
look at the globe, has a longitude and a
latitude.

59
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,370
And I can compare the longitude and
latitude of each country.

60
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,104
And the distance from, say zero longitude
to a hundred longitude is

61
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:38,970
the same as the distance from 100
longitude to 200 longitude.

62
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,834
They're equal intervals.
They're equal spaces.

63
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:50,580
So longitude, and latitude, those are
equal interval variables.

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,750
And in case you're not familiar with

65
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,090
longitude, latitude, here's an image of
the globe.

66
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,100
so, longitude just refers to the
East-West, where are

67
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,970
you on, on the globe.

68
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,740
And latitude just refers to North-South,
where are you on the globe.

69
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,338
And again, the point of this interval
variable is the distance

70
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:24,522
between, say, zero degrees latitude, which
is the equator,

71
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:29,475
which is right here.
The distance between zero degrees

72
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:33,810
latitude and, say, 30 degrees latitude is
the same as the

73
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,300
distance between 30 degrees latitude and
60 degrees latitude.

74
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,820
So this distance is equal to this
distance.

75
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,936
That's the point of an interval variable,
is the

76
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:54,934
intervals between each unit are equal, so
we call them equal

77
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,810
interval variables.

78
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,600
Okay, the final type of variable is a
ratio, variable.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,570
This is the same as interval, but they
also have a true zero point.

80
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,730
So, what I mean by a true zero point, so
let's take population.

81
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,655
When I talked about ranking the different

82
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,570
countries, all I was doing is ranking
them.

83
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,730
I wasn't talking about the actual
population.

84
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,432
If I wanted

85
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:28,878
to look at the actual population,
population is a ratio variable,

86
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:33,110
and it's a ratio variable because it has a
zero point.

87
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,910
So if the population of a country is zero,
that's meaningful.

88
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:42,610
That's, that means that it's, humans are
extinct in that country, right?

89
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,200
So it's a true, what we call a true zero,
another example is age.

90
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,649
If your age is zero, you could really

91
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,322
have no age.

92
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:54,246
another good example, and an example we're
going to

93
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:57,020
use a lot in the next segment, is
Temperature.

94
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,236
So temperature on the Kelvin scale, we're
not used to temperature on the Kelvin

95
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,034
scale unless you've taken a lot of

96
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:05,640
chemistry courses, you might be used to
that.

97
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,510
But temperature on the Kelvin scale is a
ratio

98
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,310
variable, because, zero Kelvin is absolute
zero, no temperature,

99
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,770
it's absolute zero.

100
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,890
The temperature on a Kelvin scale is a
good example of ratio variables.

101
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,966
So in this classic, paper by Stevens in
1946, he came

102
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:34,212
up with these four distinct categories or
types of variables.

103
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:36,728
because there are different types of
things

104
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:39,390
we can do with these kinds of variables.

105
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,570
I know this font is a little fuzzy and
hard to see.

106
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,052
I purposely cut and paste this table from

107
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:49,162
Stevens 1946, because I think it's an
important paper.

108
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:50,280
everyone should read it.

109
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,945
If you can get your hands on Stevens,
1946,

110
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:56,134
or, maybe we should post it to the
website.

111
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:59,542
it's a classic paper for statistics, and
also a classic

112
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:04,906
paper, paper for cognitive psychology and
for psychometrics in general.

113
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:09,280
I won't go through the whole, whole slide.
You can look at this at your leisure.

114
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,690
The point is that, a variable of type,
say,

115
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,100
nominal only allows us to do certain
things.

116
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:24,180
It only allows me to say, are two entities
equal or not equal?

117
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,100
So are you from the same country or
different countries?

118
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,656
So if I take two students at random from
this

119
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:35,150
course, and I just know this nominal
variable country of origin.

120
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,782
All I can do is say are you from

121
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,850
the same country or are you from a
different country.

122
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,060
I can't say anything about greater than or
less than.

123
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,044
I can just say are you from the same or
different.

124
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:50,310
That's all, that's all nominal variables
allow us to do.

125
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:57,240
As you go down this, this list, you'll see
as you go from nominal to ordinal to

126
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,690
interval to ratio you are allowed to ask
more and more questions of your variables.

127
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:11,490
So for ordinal, I can ask not only are you
the same or different but I can ask.

128
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,700
Are you ranked higher or lower?

129
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,330
So, do you come from the same or different
countries?

130
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,390
And does your country have a greater than
or

131
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,540
less than population than the other
student, and so on.

132
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,750
With interval, I can ask questions about
by how much are you different, alright?

133
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,990
If I just have rank orderings.

134
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,530
So if your just, if, all I know is

135
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,380
you come from the country that has the
greatest population.

136
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,865
And then I know that you come from

137
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:41,850
the country that has the second greatest
population.

138
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,400
I can't ask, well, what's the difference
in population?

139
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,100
That's what interval and ratio variables
allow us to ask.

140
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,460
Just, another example, perhaps a little
more intuitive.

141
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,624
Think about the, the people

142
00:09:56,624 --> 00:10:04,040
who are running a race or swimming against
each other in a swim meet.

143
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,650
You know, you can get first place, second
place, third place.

144
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,600
Like in the Olympics, you get the gold
medal,

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,310
you get the silver medal, you get the
bronze medal.

146
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,560
If all I know is the rank ordering, that's
the ordinal variable.

147
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,640
Just first place, second place, third
place, who

148
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,820
got gold, who got silver, who got bronze.

149
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,780
If that's all I know then I can't ask,
well, by how much did the winner win?

150
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,732
So was it as really close race between
first

151
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:33,980
place and second, rr, was it just a
blowout?

152
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,850
So the person who won was way ahead of the
person in second.

153
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,778
If all I know are the rankings, if all I
know are the ordinal variable, then I

154
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:48,177
can't answer that question about distance.
But if I have their time,

155
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:52,701
say it's a running race, or a swimming
competition, if

156
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:57,780
I have time, that's a ratio variable,
there's a true zero.

157
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,750
Then I can ask questions about, well, by
how much did

158
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,810
the winner come in first place over the
second place finisher?

159
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,030
And by how much did the second place
finisher

160
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,140
come ahead of the third place finisher,
and so on.

161
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,261
So, as you go down this list.
You're able

162
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:18,812
to ask more detailed questions.
And so, in statistics and in this course,

163
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:24,520
we're going to strive for variables, that
give us that interval or ratio scale.

164
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,912
We can't always do that, but ideally we'll
use interval

165
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:32,240
or ratio variables because they're the
richest in terms of information.

166
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,540
They allow us to ask the most in-depth
questions of our data.

167
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,200
So just to quickly preview the variables
that we're going to use in this course.

168
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,650
In experimental research, I talked about
independent variables.

169
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,059
So, for example, in the Polio vaccine

170
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,630
trials, the independent variable was the
treatment.

171
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,780
Whether the child received the vaccine, or
the placebo, that's a nominal variable.

172
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,750
They either got vaccine or placebo.

173
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:04,368
like, the memory

174
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:05,670
training experiment.

175
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,600
They either got training, or they didn't
get training.

176
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,320
That's just the nominal variable.

177
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,024
Subjects are randomly assigned to one of
those two conditions.

178
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,832
the quasi-independent variables are also
an

179
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:19,130
example, so the sports related concussion.

180
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,960
Here was concussion, no concussion.

181
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,194
Those are just nominal groups.

182
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:28,440
another good or popular quasi-independent
variable is genders female, male.

183
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:35,293
we'll typically use interval and ratio
variables as our dependent

184
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:39,943
variables, or as our measured variables in
correlational

185
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:45,064
research.
So, for example, the rate of polio in a

186
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:50,356
community, like how many kids out of a
thousand, acquire

187
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:55,970
polio after the vaccine, that was our
dependent variable.

188
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,282
Or we could look at score on an
intelligence test, or

189
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:06,480
score on a personality survey, those are
in the interval ratio type.

190
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,145
And finally it's important to keep track

191
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:14,840
of whether your variable are discreet or
continuous.

192
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,360
So, what I mean by discreet variables are
examples like nominal variables.

193
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,550
They are discrete categories, separate
categories.

194
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,216
Whereas continuous variables are like the
interval and

195
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:32,180
the ratio type, where there's just a
continuum.

196
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,583
So, we have this scale on,

197
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:37,250
in, say, like, an intelligence test, and
it's just a continuum.

198
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:41,140
ordinal variables are a little tricky.

199
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,570
They're technically categories, right?

200
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:50,432
If they're, if I only have, say, first,
second, and third, gold, silver, bronze.

201
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:54,447
those are like categories, but they're
ordered and in some

202
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:58,150
cases we might want to take averages of
ordinal variables.

203
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,934
And then they'd

204
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,920
look more like interval or ratio.

205
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,959
So we'll talk more about that later as we
get into some actual analysis.

206
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,090
So, to sum up this segment, the main point
is that there

207
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,390
are different types of variables that
we're going to use throughout the course.

208
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,980
And that statisticians use to do their
research.

209
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,030
And it's really important at the outset
that you

210
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,860
always know what types of variable you're
dealing with.

211
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,006
Because you can only apply certain

212
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:29,660
statistical procedures, to, variables of
certain types.

213
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,696
So just remember that there are four
different types,

214
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,470
Nominal, Ordinal, Interval and Ratio.

215
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,530
And know that as you go from nominal to
ratio, you're

216
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,480
allowed to ask more and more interesting
questions of your data.

217
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,350
And that's the end of this segment.
