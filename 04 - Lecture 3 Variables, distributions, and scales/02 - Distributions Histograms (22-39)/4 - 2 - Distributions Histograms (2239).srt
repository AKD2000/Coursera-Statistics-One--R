1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,220
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,710
We're up to lecture three segment two, and
in this segment we're going to talk about

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,540
distributions, and we'll look at
distributions in graphs called histograms.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,180
So a histogram is one of the simplest
graphs that

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,100
we use in statistics But they're very
useful, and very informative.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,200
So it's just a type of graph, that's used
to display a distribution.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,830
So you might think why start with
histograms, there

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,640
are lots of fancier graphics that we could
start with.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,770
but a histogram is nice.
Because it helps us to overcome

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,220
our some natural tendency to rely on
summary statistics.

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,160
And this is just a natural thing.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,290
As an analogy, think of just stereotyping.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,830
It's very easy to stereotype individuals.

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,920
Who are part of a group, because you can
rely on your sort

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,240
of summary statistics, of that group to
make an inference about an individual.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,090
But, as we know, we shouldn't do that, if
we want to get to know individuals

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,170
within a group.

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,460
We want to look at the entire
distribution.

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,360
We want to look at everybody within the
group before we calculate those Summary

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,240
statistics, or jump to those conclusions,
those summary conclusions about a group.

21
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,930
So here's a quick example of a

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,200
nice, normal distribution plotted in a
histogram.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,780
So, we're going to look at a lot of

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,100
histograms in this segment, and throughout
the course.

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,390
They'll always take on the same form.

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,650
So on the X axis, I'm plotting whatever
variable it is that I'm looking at.

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,880
In this case, it's the, the example is
body temperature present measured in

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,700
degrees Fahrenheit.
And on the, Y

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,250
axis, all I have is frequencies just the
number of people in this

30
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,460
distribution, in this sample, that have
this particular body temperature.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,350
So, in a second I'll do this in

32
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,170
Celsius because I know we have
international audience.

33
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,810
But in, in Fahrenheit,

34
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,500
normal body temperature is about 98.6
degrees.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,410
That's what most people go with.

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,570
so if you look where 98.6 degrees is right
about here.

37
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,080
So, yeah.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,589
It's right about at the average.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
this group runs a little hot, you might
say.

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,170
so that's a nice, normal distribution.
A characteristic of a normal

41
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,990
distribution is, if I wanted to sort of
smooth this, I could draw a curve over it.

42
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,730
It has this nice, bell shaped curve to it.

43
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,962
And the way to spot a normal distribution,
is to look for that signature bell shaped

44
00:02:56,962 --> 00:03:03,560
curve, and it's symmetrical around the
mean, around the average.

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,720
So you see there's just to,

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,770
the, the number of cases beyond the mean,
is

47
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,250
about equal to the number of cases below
the mean.

48
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,119
So it's symmetrical, and has this nice
normal bell shaped curve.

49
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:25,290
Here's the same exact data, just plotted,
in terms of Celsius, so now on the

50
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,770
X axis you see we're just plotting
temperature measured in degrees Celsius.

51
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,770
Again it's a normal distribution.

52
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:41,710
We did these graphics in R, and you're,
you've seen R a little bit, in the labs.

53
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,800
and R just bins these differently.
So you can see the width

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,080
of these bins, are, are different.

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,420
And again you can set that if you remember
using the R function hist.

56
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,200
And the argument breaks.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,850
You can change that if you like.
But this is just the same exact

58
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,450
data, plotted in Celsius instead of in

59
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,780
Fahrenheit.
So those are nice, normal distributions.

60
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,930
but histograms can reveal a lot of

61
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,570
information captured that's not captured
by summary statistics.

62
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,760
so just for an example, let's run with
this body temperature example.

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,960
Assume a few kids in the class are sick,
just a, a, a couple.

64
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,540
They have the flu for example ,and they
have a really high body temperature.

65
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,130
We might not capture that just by getting
say the

66
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,130
average body temperature across the whole
group, especially if it's a really

67
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,480
large group, right, Those a couple of
kinds who are sick won't really show up.

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,600
But if we look at the histogram, then what
we'll see is, if like, here's

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,580
one kid out here, who has temperature of
like over 101.

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,268
I actually had a temperature of over 101

71
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:13,860
last week, it was nasty.
so here's this kid, this

72
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,450
one kid in the distribution, so, it's not
quite normal, it's more like this.

73
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,820
Alright?

74
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,730
If I had to smooth it out.
So that's what's called a skewed

75
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:31,460
distribution, and this is a positive skew.
And the way to remember that is,

76
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,200
the skew is where there's few.
So there are fewer scores at the positive,

77
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,950
or high end, of this distribution.
That's why it's a positive skew.

78
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,630
Okay, so the skew is where there's few.
This is a positively skewed distribution.

79
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,560
This is the same exact graphic, just

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,270
presented again in Celsius instead of in
Fahrenheit.

81
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,900
And again we don't get a nice normal
distribution.

82
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,940
We get something that looks more like
that.

83
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,200
It's not quite as skewed as I drew before,
but

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,830
[LAUGH]

85
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,870
you get the point.
It's a little bit positively skewed.

86
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,320
Now again, not all distributions are
normal.

87
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,870
We're going to assume normal
distributions, for a lot of

88
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,540
the statistical procedures that we do in
this course.

89
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,620
but, we need to examine that first.

90
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,510
So, a first step in a lot of our labs, and
in a lot of

91
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,670
the homework assignments, will be to plot

92
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,650
histograms, and determine if we have
normal distributions.

93
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,240
But there are lots of distributions that
are not normal.

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,210
So let's look at a couple that are not
normal.

95
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,260
So, again, I'm going to run with this body
temperature example, for a few more slides

96
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,220
and say, say we have 1 group of children.
The entire group had the flu.

97
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,800
Say a whole classroom full of children got

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,770
sick with the flu, and then they were
treated.

99
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,790
They were given, say, antibiotics (as I

100
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,250
was last week, than goodness for the
antibiotics

101
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,275
[LAUGH]

102
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,600
).

103
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,520
And one thing that can happen with
antibiotics, is

104
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,650
it can actually suppress your body
temperature a bit.

105
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,610
So, after getting the antibiotics, that
group of children, their body

106
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,520
temperatures might be a little bit below
average relative to normal.

107
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,110
and then, let's compare them to a second
group, a second classroom of

108
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,210
kids, who also got infected with the flu,
but maybe, say, a week later.

109
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,490
So, their body temperatures are still
high.

110
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,380
Okay.

111
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,890
Let's look at that in, in graphics.

112
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,670
Again, I'm going to do this first in
Fahrenheit, then in Celsius.

113
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,610
so here's a, a, on the left, a normal
distribution.

114
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,870
It's pretty normal.

115
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,266
but it's a little bit below average.
Remember I said it's, the average is 90,

116
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:58,680
98.6.
and in this case we're actually,

117
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,040
a little bit below 98, it looks like is
the average for that group.

118
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,020
And here, again, we've got a pretty
normal, not perfectly normal distribution.

119
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,110
and this group is

120
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,230
a little bit above average.

121
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,710
So we've got you know, the average looks
like it's approaching 100.

122
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,330
So this is the group of children who are,
are still sick.

123
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,830
They haven't have the antibiotics yet.

124
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,680
Imagine that, I didn't know that these are
two separate classrooms of children.

125
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Imagine that I just looked at their body
temperatures, and plotted the histogram.

126
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,180
All of them together.
So let's put

127
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,010
them together.

128
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,090
So if we put those 2 distributions
together, the, the

129
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,450
group of children who are on the
antibiotics, and their, their

130
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,970
body temperatures' a little bit below
average, with the group

131
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,630
of children who are still sick, and
haven't received the antibiotics.

132
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,290
Their body temperature is still above
normal.

133
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,090
What you'll see is the distrubution that
looks like this.

134
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,290
It's actually bimodal.

135
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,240
It has 2 modes.

136
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,990
So, if I, if you look at it carefully, you
can see

137
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,000
there's sort of a normal distribution
there, and a normal distribution there.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,600
It's the two distributions put together.

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,420
So if you didn't know that, it might be
harder to see, but the more practice you

140
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,480
get at looking at histograms, the more
you'll

141
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,660
start to see these, evidence of non normal
distributions.

142
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,750
So this is an example

143
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,660
of something that looks not normal.
Instead, I would describe this as bimodal.

144
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,620
Again, I'm just doing the same exact
thing.

145
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,490
Except here, I'm plotting everything in

146
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,920
degrees Celsius, instead of degrees
Fahrenheit.

147
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,010
So here, this group is a little, if you

148
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,040
look at the average, they're a little
below average.

149
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,340
If you look at the average for this

150
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,730
group on the right, they're a little above
average.

151
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,060
If we put them together.

152
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,160
Again, what we see

153
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,840
is something that looks a little bimodal.
You get these two peaks.

154
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,610
There's a peak here and a peak here.

155
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,840
Remember in a normal distribution there's
just one peak, in the center distribution.

156
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,780
Here we're seeing two peaks And, again,
it's evidence that we

157
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,370
have these two different samples of
children that were put together.

158
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,940
So the point of that exercise.

159
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,390
And the point of looking at all those
histograms, is to

160
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,620
just make this simple point that not all
distributions are normal.

161
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,640
Yes we are going to assume a lot of

162
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,940
normal distributions as we go forward in
this course.

163
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,400
Its easy especially for introductory
statistics to

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,560
assume a normal distribution, but we'll
make

165
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,170
that assumption, then we'll test it by

166
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,534
looking at histograms, by running the
scripted

167
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,816
statistics and r.

168
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:56,340
we'll see if we have normal distributions
or not.

169
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,540
So we'll assume normal distributions, but
just

170
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,050
keep in mind not all distributions are
normal.

171
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,370
so simply viewing a histogram often
reveals whether its not normal.

172
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,320
You might have a positive skew, you might

173
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,760
have a negative skew, you might have
something

174
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,160
that's bimodal, you might have something
that looks

175
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,240
completely out of whack not normal at all.

176
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,170
Sometimes it's hard to determine just by
looking at the historgram, and

177
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,020
it's a judgement call, there are no hard,
and fast rules about this.

178
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,960
So in that case, summary statistics will
help, and we'll

179
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,170
talk more about that in the next lecuture
on summary statistics.

180
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,120
so, the only way to really get a good

181
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,940
handle on what is a normal distribution
look like,

182
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,520
and what does a non normal distribution
look like,

183
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,980
is just to look at more and more
histograms.

184
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,740
The more experience you get with this, the
more you'll be

185
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,820
able to say, yeah, that's, that's normal
enough for our statistical procedure.

186
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,270
we'll go ahead.

187
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,100
Or that's that's too positively skewed,
that's too, negatively, negatively

188
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,170
skewed.

189
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,620
So the best way to do that is just get
experience.

190
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,150
So let's look at more distributions.

191
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,650
This can get a little tedious so while

192
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,560
we do it, we'll imagine that we're wine
tasting.

193
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,630
Or, you're at home.

194
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,570
You could start drinking wine, right now
if you haven't already

195
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,880
[LAUGH].

196
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,530
I haven't yet.
It's still.

197
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,870
In the morning here

198
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,260
[LAUGH]

199
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,680
in the US, on the East Coast.
so, let's go wine tasting.

200
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,440
So in this example, suppose that we have
100 wine experts.

201
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,070
And they're going to drink, and rate the
overall quality of eight different wines.

202
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,700
They're going to rate four red wines, and
four white wines.

203
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,860
And, in all the examples higher scores
indicate

204
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,680
higher quality.

205
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,700
So if they give it a score in the 90s that
means they really like it.

206
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,560
and let's say we had 4 countries submit 2

207
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,860
wines each, so I just picked 4 countries,
I actually

208
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,990
picked 4 countries where I know we have a
lot

209
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,840
of Korsera students in statistics 1 in
these 4 countries.

210
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,690
So it wasn't completely random, there were
4 countries with a

211
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,840
lot of students, and they're known for
producing lots of good wine.

212
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,620
So, Argentina, Australia, France, and the
US.

213
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,010
Each one submitted a red, and each one
submitted

214
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,770
a white, we again, just did this for fun,

215
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:33,130
my assistant on this, is, is from France,
so we had a lot of fun doing this example.

216
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,200
so let's say Argentina submitted a malbec,
they're

217
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,870
very known for their quality malbecs, and
a chardonnay.

218
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,530
Australia, let's say,

219
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,400
they submitted a Shiraz, and a Pinot
grigio.

220
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,390
France, let's say they submitted a
Bordeaux, and Sauvignon blanc.

221
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,480
And the US, let's say, they submitted a
Cabarnet, and a Reisling.

222
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,410
And you're going to say, Reisling from the
US?

223
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,860
Yes, upstate New York has really great
Reislings, which is where I'm from.

224
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,220
so that wasn't random.
I, I had to slip that in.

225
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,810
That was personal.

226
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,720
so the US submitted a Cabarnet, probably
from California

227
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,600
a Reisling from upstate New York, let's
say.

228
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,520
Okay.

229
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,770
To preview what we did, again we just made
up this example.

230
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,410
We had a lot of fun making this example
up.

231
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,460
and we made it up so that the red wines,

232
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:29,050
the distributions of the ratings, are
normal in the red wines.

233
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,260
But if you look at the ratings of the
white wines, those are all not normal.

234
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,320
So here are the distributions.
We just simulate a data in R.

235
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,340
It's very easy to do.

236
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,260
We'll show you how to do that in a later
lab.

237
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,640
and then we plotted them in histograms.

238
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,970
So again, what I'm looking at here on the
x axis

239
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,630
is just the wine rating, and then on the y
axis.

240
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,660
How many wine experts gave it that
particular rating?

241
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,100
So you can see, for the Argentenian red,

242
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,890
that's the Melbec, they had a nice, normal
distribution.

243
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,320
the Australian red was the Charaz, I
believe, right?

244
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,670
Un, that's a really nice, normal
distribution.

245
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,260
You can't get much more normal than that.
let's look at the

246
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,650
distributions for the French red, and the
US red.

247
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,970
the French not completely normal.

248
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,360
There's a little bit of skew there, down
there.

249
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,440
But it's pretty normal.

250
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,920
in the US again nice, normal distribution.

251
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,570
Let's compare that to some non normal
distributions.

252
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,280
So now let's look at the white wine, the
ratings for the white wine.

253
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:53,070
First if we look at the the ratings from
Argent, on the Argentinian

254
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:59,710
white wine, you see you get this one big
peak, right in the middle.

255
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,590
Right, so, most of the wine experts just
found this to

256
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,260
be a pretty good wine, It's the rating is
around seventy

257
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,400
to seventy two.
So they found it above average.

258
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,700
But most of them rated it right in that
category.

259
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,340
So it was very, very consistent.

260
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,300
All right.

261
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,090
In contrast to the Australian White, here
you'll see

262
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,050
you're getting a little bit of that
positive skew.

263
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,220
So this one's not looking as normal as the
red wines distributions.

264
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,150
There's a positive skew in this one.

265
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,060
Now let's look at France.

266
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,530
France is sort, their, their distribution
is sort of, the opposite of Argentina.

267
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:40,850
Right?

268
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,880
Instead of having one big, steep peak,

269
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,970
there is what we call a uniform
distribution.

270
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,170
That is, the ratings were all over the
place.

271
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,930
So, some of the, some of the raters loved
it.

272
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,460
Some of the raters hated it.
Okay?

273
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,040
and then, the United States white that was
the Reisling this has

274
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:13,080
a bit of a negative skew to it.
Again, the skew is where there's few.

275
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,160
So there's very few ratings right down
here at the low end.

276
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,350
So very few of the wine raters, gave that

277
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,040
US white wine, the Riesling, a really low
rating.

278
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,170
So it's a little bit negatively skewed.

279
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,430
So all of those, are just to show you
that.

280
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,440
There, in many cases, like body
temperature, like the wine

281
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,490
ratings for the red wine, we're going to
get these normal distributions.

282
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,400
And in a lot of cases in the labs, in the

283
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,580
homeworks, we're going to deal with
variables

284
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,570
that give us nice, normal distributions.

285
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,080
But we can't always assume that to be
true.

286
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,650
So we're going to have to look, and see if
there are non normal distributions

287
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,500
lurking in our data.
So to summarize this segment, we use

288
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,670
histograms to display an entire
distribution because

289
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,840
they sometimes reveal information that
summary statistics gloss over,

290
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,180
or, or, or won't tell us.
And many if not most distributions

291
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,440
that we deal with are going to be normal.
but some distributions are not normal.

292
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
And for example we looked at the bimodal
distribution

293
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,430
where the 2 classrooms of kids who were
sick.

294
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,980
The ones who were treated, and not
treated.

295
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,630
We looked at positively skewed
distributions, negatively skewed.

296
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,850
We looked at uniform distributions.
So that was like the white wine

297
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:42,990
distribution in France that's uniform, or
another phrase for that is platykurtic.

298
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,610
and the last type that we looked

299
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,050
at was leptokurtic.

300
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,090
That was like the white wine distribution
in Argentina with that one steep peak is

301
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,066
also called a leptokurtic distribution.

302
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,840
And now I just want to show you

303
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,560
a couple of advance visuals, or advanced
histograms,

304
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,580
and if we could zoom in on these, if you
could zoom in on the top

305
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,130
And then the bottom.

306
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,650
since we've talked about longitude, and
latitude,

307
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,490
and we've talked about histograms, I
wanted

308
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:23,770
to show just these two, very cool graphics
that I just picked off the internet.

309
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,430
what this shows is the world population As
a

310
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:32,183
function of latitude, and as a function of
longitude.

311
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,930
So, if you look at the top graph, what
we're

312
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:40,110
plotting is, you get this like nice,
normal distribution pretty much, right.

313
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,320
What that means is, most people live
around the equator and

314
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,350
as you move away from the equator, fewer
and fewer people live in those places.

315
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,330
the same can't be said about longitude,
right?

316
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:01,050
So if we look at the bottom graph, we
don't get a nice, normal distribution.

317
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,210
Instead, we get like a peak here, a peak
here.

318
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,030
What are those peaks?

319
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,450
Well, here this peak is probably China.

320
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,910
This peak reflects the population in
India.

321
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:17,250
All right, so, where you have a normal
distribution of population around

322
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:23,390
latitude, centered around the Equator, the
same can't be said for longitude.

323
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,380
the distribution is not normal the
population

324
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,140
distribution is not normal across
longitude.

325
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,850
Just one more example, of sort of advanced
graphics that you can do.

326
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,270
there's lots of these available on the
Internet.

327
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,580
This one is right on Coursera's homepage,
so if you want

328
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,850
to know more about where Coursera's
students are logging in from.

329
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,580
And where their country of origin is you
can look at this graphic by Coursera,

330
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,870
and what Coursera did is they just plotted
ar, around the globe.

331
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:03,030
they colored different countries, and the
darker the color given to a country

332
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,640
reflects more students, more Coursera
students from that country.

333
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,580
So you can see we have allot of students
from China,

334
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,310
we have allot of students from India,
allot of students from

335
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,040
Australia and so on.
These little circles refer to institutions

336
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,110
that are partners with Coursera.
So this is a fun graphic.

337
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,410
It's actually interactive on the home page
on Coursera, you can play with it.

338
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:38,230
so here we are in, in Asia I can move
around

339
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,710
the globe, and there you see Europe is
very well represented.

340
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:51,200
Some parts of Africa are represented, but
we have a ways to go I would say.

341
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,140
And then if I keep moving around the globe
to the west.

342
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,350
Oops.

343
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,568
Keep moving around the globe to the west.

344
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,150
Here's the U.S., of course lots of partner

345
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,550
institutions, that's, those are all the
circles in

346
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,135
the U.S., so, lots of students from the

347
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:09,760
U.S., lots of students from Canada, lots
of

348
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,890
students from Brazil as well, and South
America.

349
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,710
And again, that's available on the
Coursera

350
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,480
webpage if you want to look at that.

351
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,450
So, an example of, sort of Putting
distributions

352
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,500
into advanced graphics, and there are lots
of

353
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,220
other examples you might run into on the

354
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,060
internet, or in the news, that do similar
things.

355
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,620
So that's the end of this segment.
