1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,250
Hi welcome back, we are in lecture 11

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,240
and the topic in the lecture is Multiple
Regression.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,680
In the first segment I did an overview, we
talked

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,060
about how to interpret coefficients in a
multiple regression equation.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,620
Now we are going to talk about how those
coefficients are escalated and

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,920
to understand that you need to know a
little bit about matrix algebra.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,880
So I'm throwing in this segment for those
of you who have no exposure

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,100
to Matrix algebra or if you feel like you
need a little brush up.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,340
If you're really comfortable with matrix
algebra, then you might want to

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,260
go ahead and skip this segment and go on
to segment three.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,600
So this is a very skimpy but basic
introduction to matrix algebra.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,350
We are just going to do

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,870
some simple things, addition, subtraction,
multiplication

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,180
and I will point out some very special
types of matrices

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,490
along the way that hopefully you will
recognize and you will see the connection

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,919
between matrix algebra and statistics
particularly multiple regression.

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,310
So first to start out, What's a matrix?
so a matrix is just a rectangular

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,496
table, of known or unknown numbers.
so.

19
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:26,712
it has a number of rows, a number of
columns the order

20
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:30,635
of the matrix is always number of rows
first then number of columns.

21
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:36,882
So this matrix that I am showing you here
M is a 4 by 2 matrix 4 rows, 2 columns.

22
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:41,710
But again to, to reinforce that its rows
then columns, I always tell my students

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,479
here at Princeton the way to remember that

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,634
is matrix algebra is really cool, rows,
columns.

25
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:49,359
It's really cool.

26
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,360
So, rows, columns.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,669
It's a 4 by 2.

28
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:57,257
So one common manipulation of a matrix in
matrix algebra and particularly

29
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:00,143
when you're doing calculations for
multiple

30
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:02,511
regression, is to take the transpose

31
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:04,130
of the matrix.

32
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,860
And to transpose a matrix, you just change
the rows and columns.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,150
So here, to take the transpose of M, M sub
superscript T, all I

34
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,370
did was just flip the matrix so that the
rows are now the columns.

35
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,633
So now, instead of having a 4 by 2, I have
a 2 by 4.

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,270
Addition and subtraction in matrix algebra
is really simple, and it doesn't

37
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,460
take really much, knowing much more than
just basic addition and subtraction.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,580
The only thing to know is that, the only
way you can add or

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,550
subtract 2 matrices is they have to be the
same size with the same order.

40
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,880
So if I want to add say matrix M and N
they both need to be

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,580
the same size, they both are 4 by 2 here
and then

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,870
to add them I just take each corresponding
element and add them.

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:08,110
So I go to row 1, column 1 In matrix M,
row 1 column 1, in matrix N,

44
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:15,230
add those and I get my result and I just
do that for each cell and each matrix.

45
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,140
That's real simple.

46
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:26,028
Matrix multiplication is a little bit
trickier but again not too difficult.

47
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:31,857
the one thing to know and remember as
we're going through these calculations is

48
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:37,942
that 2 matrices can only be multiplied if
they're what's called conformable.

49
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,930
And what that means is the number of
columns

50
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,752
in the first matrix, must be equal to the

51
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:46,380
number of rows in the second matrix.

52
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,550
That's what it means for 2 matrices to be
conformable.

53
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,378
This is the technical way it's written out
for mat, matrix, matrix

54
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:03,924
multiplication, what we're going to do is
take the transpose of matrix

55
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:09,271
M and multiply it by matrix N.
Remember I, I, I cu, can't multiply

56
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:13,920
M and N, because they're the same order.
They're both 4 by 2.

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:22,392
So it I take the transpose of M, then I
have a 2 by 4 multiplied by a 4 by 2.

58
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:24,230
then that works.
So it's

59
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,422
[UNKNOWN].

60
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,580
So let's see how this works.

61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,190
So I took the transpose of M, so M was a 4
by 2.

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,820
Now it's a 2 by 4 and I'm going to
multiply it by N.

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,150
So I have a 2 by 4 matrix multiplied by a
4 by 2, 4 by 2.

64
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:53,148
So this is, 2 by 4, and I'm going to
multiply

65
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:58,240
that by a 4 by 2.
What that will give

66
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,425
me is a 2 by 2 product matrix.

67
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:08,790
It's a 2 by 2 so number of rows in the

68
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,560
first matrix and the number of columns in
the second matrix.

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,160
That's an easy way to start learning how
to do matrix multiplication is think

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,100
about what's the product going to look
like.

71
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,728
So if I'm multiplying a 2 by 4 times a 4
by

72
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:27,640
2 then I know I'm going to wind up with a
product matrix.

73
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,320
That's a 2 by 2 and this is the product
out here.

74
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,300
So the way I'd like this when I first
started leaning how to do this

75
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,440
way back in grad school is think about the
product matrix and how will I get

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,530
row 1, column 1 of this matrix.
Well to get,

77
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,475
the way to get row 1, column 1 is to go
across row

78
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:58,670
1 of the first matrix and down column 1 of

79
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,130
the second matrix.
So what I am going to do is take the first

80
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,700
element in row 1, that's the number 1

81
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,080
times the first element of column 1 in the
second matrix, that's the number 2.

82
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,340
So its 1 times 2, and then I am going to
add

83
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,240
the second element in the first row of the
first matrix

84
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:31,340
times the second element of the first
column in the second matrix.

85
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,530
So it's 5 times 4.
So what

86
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:41,783
I'm doing is 1 times 2, plus 5 times 4,
plus 3 times 1, plus 4 times 3.

87
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,360
So let's go through that again.

88
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,403
That's 1 times 2 is 2 plus 5 times 4 is 20
so

89
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:54,323
I'm at 22, plus 3 times 1 so now I'm at 25

90
00:06:54,323 --> 00:07:00,380
plus 4 times 3 that's 12.
That gives me 37.

91
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,960
So how did I get row 1 column 1 of the
product matrix?

92
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,470
I went across row 1 of the first, first
matrix, down column 1 of the second

93
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:17,270
matrix, I multiplied each corresponding
element, and took the sum of the products.

94
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,401
And that got me 37.

95
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:25,480
We could do that for row 2, column 1 so
now I am in row 2,

96
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,690
column 1, so its 2 times 2

97
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,610
is 4 plus 1 times 4 is 4 that's 8 plus

98
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,600
4 times 1 is 12 plus 2 times 3, gives me
18.

99
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,040
Okay, that's how matrix multiplication
works.

100
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,405
Fortunately, R does this for us.

101
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:51,740
[LAUGH]

102
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,290
Right?

103
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,920
but, it's sort of essential to understand
how it works.

104
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,180
So you can see how the regression

105
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,160
coefficients are estimated when you are
doing multiple

106
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,320
regression, because that's what, this is
what R

107
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,180
is using as it estimates the regression
coefficients.

108
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,180
So in the next 10 slides to illustrate
addition, subtraction, multiplication.

109
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm going to go from a raw data matrix.
You can think of this like a data frame.

110
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,710
An R to a correlation matrix.
Just in ten thoughts.

111
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,900
So here let's look at a raw data frame.
this is a matrix.

112
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,530
Again, if you think about a data frame
it's a matrix.

113
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,720
Right?

114
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,590
we talked about that in Lab one.

115
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,470
for, when we were first learning about how
to manipulate objects in R.

116
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,570
so we can think of this as having ten
rows.

117
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,060
That's like having ten subjects in a, in,
in a, study measured on

118
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,320
three variables.

119
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,570
And you can imagine these are numbers on
like a

120
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,540
Likert scale of like 1 to 5 or 1 to 7.

121
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,150
So we just have 10 people and 3 variables.

122
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,020
the first thing I want to do is sum up
those columns.

123
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,210
And again, think about how you would do
this just in regular algebra.

124
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,500
Forget matrix algebra.

125
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:23,230
how would we calculate the correlation
coefficient?

126
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,640
No, we did that way back in I think week 2
or 3.

127
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,900
How do we calculate correlation
coefficients?

128
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,680
Well we've got the sums of squares, the
sums of cross products.

129
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,500
Right it's the sum of cross products over
the sum of squares.

130
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,600
How do you get sum of squares?

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,100
Well the first thing you do is you get the
mean, then you

132
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,900
get the deviation scores, then you square

133
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,460
the deviation scores, you get some
squares.

134
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,780
So, that's exactly what we're going to do
here, it's just we're doing

135
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,760
it in matrix algebra, which sounds fancy,
but it's the same thing.

136
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,830
So the first step is sum all

137
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,540
the scores in a column.
Because I want to get means.

138
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,290
So I sum all the scores and that gets me
this

139
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,960
matrix, it's a 1 by 3 matrix, or it's just
a vector,

140
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,746
right.
I got those sums because then

141
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:24,602
I want to get means.
So if I multiply that matrix

142
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:29,386
of sums times 10 to the negative 1 that's
the same as saying

143
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:34,630
dividing by 10, but that's how we write
this in matrix algebra,

144
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,362
then I get the means.

145
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:41,619
So now I have a matrix of means or what I
call here a row vector of means.

146
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:52,400
Now I can get an entire matrix of means if
I just take a column vector of 1s.

147
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,290
That's this guy.

148
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,720
It's a column vector because it's just 1
vector.

149
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,300
I'm sorry, 1 column.

150
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,160
Multiply it by this row vector of means,
now I have a matrix of means.

151
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,830
Why do I want a matrix of means?

152
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,790
Well because,

153
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,920
I want to get a matrix of deviation
scores.

154
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,200
Remember how did we do this in basic
algebra?

155
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,500
We calculated deviation scores, and then
we squared deviation scores.

156
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:28,620
So now, if I just take my matrix, my, my
original data matrix

157
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:37,130
and subtract the matrix of, of means, then
my result is a matrix of deviation scores.

158
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,820
Now this is the really cool parts, the
most important piece.

159
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,740
If I take that matrix of deviation scores
and pre-multiply

160
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,920
it by its own transpose, then what do we
get?

161
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,330
We get a matrix of sum of squares and sum
of prospects.

162
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,450
Isn't that cool?

163
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:03,340
I think that's cool.
So down here, this matrix is the sum

164
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,600
of squares and the sum of cross products.
The sum of squares are in a diagonal,

165
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,780
and the sum of cross products are in the
off diagonal.

166
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,870
Why is that?
Well, what's in the diagonal?

167
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:28,140
Let's go to row 1 column 1.
I would go across row 1, down column 1.

168
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,339
What I'm doing is taking each deviation
score, and multiplying it by itself.

169
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,200
That's the deviation score squared, and
then summing them all, right?

170
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,480
That's sum of squares, pretty cool huh?

171
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,080
How do I get some cross products well it's
just by doing x and y, same thing.

172
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,880
So, this is a really nice trick and a
fundamental pieces of statistics that

173
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,810
matrix algebra, there are some, some
special matrices that correspond to

174
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,650
really conceptually important pieces of,
of basic stats in multiple regression.

175
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,570
So now I think you see we're near the
finish line.

176
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,310
We have these sum of the squares and sums
of cross products.

177
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,870
So now if we just divide by N again I am
doing multiple, I am

178
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,605
doing matrix algebra and notations so we
will multiply times N to the negative 1.

179
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,140
then I get a variance, co variance matrix

180
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,030
and I can standardized that by multiplying
by the

181
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,590
standard deviation matrix.

182
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:40,950
And if I do that then I finish with the
correlation matrix.

183
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:47,250
So that last piece was just a standardized
things so that I get a diagonal of 1s.

184
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,300
Because each variable correlated with
itself is 1.

185
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,829
And then in the off-diagonals, again this
is a symmetrical matrix.

186
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,750
so the correlation between the first

187
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,220
column and second column is negative.19
and

188
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,090
between the first column and third column

189
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,966
is negative.09 and second, third column
is.44.

190
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:10,260
So that's the correlation matrix.

191
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,280
Again important things to take away this
is

192
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,490
really just purely a mathematical lesson
so that

193
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,920
we can move on to the next segment

194
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,810
and learn how to interpret the regression
coefficients.

195
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,310
know how to add, subtract, and multiply
matrices

196
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,660
and recognize that there's some sort of
special matrices.

197
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,260
In matrix algebra that correspond directly
to really important

198
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,340
concepts in, in basic stats, like the
correlation matrix,

199
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,600
sum of squares, sum of cross products and
variance/covariance matrix.
