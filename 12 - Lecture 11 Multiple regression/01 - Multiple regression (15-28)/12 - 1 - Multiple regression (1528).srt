1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,630
Hi, welcome back to statistics one.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,830
We're up to lecture eleven and the topic
today is multiple regression.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,490
So, this lecture is divided into three
segments, in the first segment

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,700
I'll just introduce you to some basic
concepts in multiple regression, we've

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,460
already covered simple regression on a,
and you saw a glimpse of

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,610
multiple regression but we will get into
it a little bit more

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,650
deeply in this first section.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,000
In the second segment we'll sort of take a
detour basically just into pure math

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,490
and I will introduce you to matrix algebra
if you haven't done matrix algebra before,

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,640
and the reason I am doing that is To
understand how the regression coefficients

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,020
are estimated in a multiple regression you
sort of have to have at least a basic

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,060
understanding of ma, of matrix algebra to
see how these are estimated all at once.

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,850
So we'll do a little bit of matrix algebra

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,220
in the second segment, and then in the
third

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,380
segment we'll walk through how the
regression coefficients are estimated in

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,460
this larger regression equation that
includes multiple predictors.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,170
So first, Segment one.
let's look at multiple

18
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,180
regression, just sort of an overview.

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,710
And again, the important things to take
away here

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,520
are, the, the components of the multiple
regression equation.

21
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,690
and sort of, most importantly for this
segment, how to interpret

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:42,390
regression coefficients when there are
multiple coefficients in the model.

23
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,630
And this is a difficult topic, that even
advanced

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,170
researchers sometimes mix up and make
mistakes on.

25
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,290
so I'm going to, take my time and, and

26
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,170
really try and reinforce how to interpret
these coefficients.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,370
So again just to make this distinction
between simple

28
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,140
regression and multiple regression real
easy, so simple regression

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,590
just has one predictor in the model,
multiple regression

30
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,279
you can have as many predictors as you
want.

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,020
So, here is the multiple regression
equation.

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,780
You saw this when we first talked about
regression about a week ago.

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,990
I am just putting in more predictors.
We are going to estimate multiple betas.

34
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,610
So to be clear.

35
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,150
we're going to have a predicted value on
the outcome variable Y.

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,200
We still have a regression constant.

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,850
That's just the predicted score on Y when
all the Xs are zero.

38
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,560
we have a bunch of predictor variables now
which

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,640
means we're going to have a bunch of
unstandardized regression coefficients.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,750
We still have residuals, so we're going to
get one

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,880
predicted score for each individual, and
each individual has one

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,620
observed score, so we just have one
residual per person.

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,960
And I'm using k here to denote just

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,680
the number of predictors in the multiple
regression equation.

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,170
We still can calculate a multiple
correlation coefficient, because remember

46
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,750
that's the correlation between the
predicted scores and the observed scores.

47
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,400
And this is a way of evaluating the
overall model.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,380
And we

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,020
can square that multiple correlation
coefficient

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,180
to get R squared, and that tells

51
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,860
us the percentage of variance in the

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,440
outcome measure that's explained by the
model.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,530
And again that's a way to evaluate the
overall model.

54
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,030
It's a way to compare competing models.

55
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,260
The example I'm going to use for multiple
regression.

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:46,915
Is one in which we predict faculty salary
from a series of predictors.

57
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:51,320
So, what are some things that might
predict a faculty member's salary?

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,410
Well, one obvious one, and it, it is is
the strongest predictor in this example,

59
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,800
is just time since the person's PhD.
So people who have been out of school

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,570
longer, been working longer, they tend to
make more money.

61
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,040
But another predictor is, how many
publications,

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,460
particularly peer review publication an
individual has.

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,170
So, if a faculty member is really prolific
and publishes a lot.

64
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:25,400
That means they tend to be very marketable
and their salary is probably much higher.

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,970
So we could expect probably

66
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,790
a positive correlation between number of

67
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,220
publications and salary and, possibly,
gender.

68
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,660
Unfortunately particularly in the past but
even

69
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,670
to this day, there's some slight gender
inequity.

70
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,190
you might see a difference between men and
women.

71
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
so we could look at that in this
regression equation.

72
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,920
So first I'm just going to show you some
summary statistics.

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,040
because when, you'll see when we interpret
coefficients.

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,820
you can sometimes lose sight of the actual

75
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,760
summary statistics because you will see
some discrepancies.

76
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,930
So first let's just, just look at some
summary statistics.

77
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,070
I'm borrowing this example from

78
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,700
a previous example which is now a little
outdated.

79
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,830
these are U.S. dollars.

80
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,750
so if you are in the U.S. and you are
envisioning a career

81
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,960
in academia don't worry it gets, it gets a
little better than this.

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,580
This is an older example.
so the average salary for professors

83
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,400
in this example was 64,000 with a standard
deviation of 17,000.

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,500
time since the PhD was about eight years.

85
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,230
So these are relatively young faculty
members.

86
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,570
It's funny when I used this example years
ago I,

87
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,610
I didn't think eight years out was young,
now I do.

88
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,930
eight years out is young.

89
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,030
with a standard deviation of, of about
five years.

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,700
And they have on average about 15

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,503
publications with the standard deviation
about 7.5.

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,935
also because gender is a nominal variable
remember we

93
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:21,050
haven't really dealt with this situation
yet in regression we can't just throw in a

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,890
nominal variable into regression equation
without giving it some code because R

95
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,080
when it, when it runs that LM function it
needs a numeric value.

96
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,280
So, we need to code

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,020
male and female somehow.

98
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,970
So I just coded male as zero, female as
one.

99
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,270
Those are just arbitrary you can do it the
other way it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,190
So if we ran this in R we would use the LM
function.

101
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,050
Same thing as regular regression we just
add in more predictors.

102
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,840
So I did LM, salary is the outcome
measure,

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,710
so it's salary tilde and then all your
predictors.

104
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,990
Time plus Pubs plus Gender.
Notice it's, see, see the GLM in there, we

105
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,980
covered the GLM it's right there.
It's Y is a function of these

106
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:18,400
predictors time, publications and gender.
I ran that in R and, and here's my output.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,010
so I get 46,911 plus and those are the

108
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,940
slopes relating each individual predictor
to the outcome measure, salary.

109
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,700
But let's really think about what these
numbers mean and I'm

110
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,460
going to ask some questions to get you
think about this.

111
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,790
oops sorry before I do I did summarize all
those coefficients

112
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:46,560
in a table of coefficients so you'll see
this in your R-output,

113
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,220
actually you've seen this when you did
simple regression, but when you

114
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,730
do multiple regression in R you'll, it'll
look a lot like this.

115
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,550
you'll see first, the unstandardized
coefficients.

116
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,650
So that's, in the first column, those are
unstandardized coefficients.

117
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,732
So to be clear, like 46,911, that's the
predicted score on Y when all Xx

118
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:18,660
are zero and these are the individual
slopes for each predictor.

119
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,840
you have a standard error associated with
each

120
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,900
one of those, remember, cause each one of
those is just a point estimate.

121
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,910
Now that we've talked about confidence
intervals, T is just the un-standardized

122
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,840
regression coefficient over standard
error, I'm

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,050
using beta here to reflect the
standardized coefficient, and

124
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,980
I just put that in so you can compare
them.

125
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,560
And then you get a P value associated with
each one.

126
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,620
And then down here again at the bottom, is
just the overall regression equation.

127
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,370
Now let's get to those questions that I
talked about.

128
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,160
And I'm asking these just to get you to
think carefully about this

129
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,950
output, and, and this outcome, and what
these coefficients really mean.

130
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,910
So what is 46,911?
What is 502?

131
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,000
If you look back at the table, you could

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,335
ask who makes more money, men or women.
according to the model,

133
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:28,360
is that difference between men and women,
is it statistically significant, according

134
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,276
to this model?
What's the strongest predictor of salary

135
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:42,190
well let's, let's answer those.
So 46,911 was the regression constant.

136
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,250
What is that?

137
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,480
It's the predicted score on Y when all the
X's are zero.

138
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,050
So it's when someone has no time since
their PhD so they just graduated.

139
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:03,502
They have no publications, and what was
coded as zero, well I coded men as zero.

140
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,740
So 46,911.

141
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,050
If you think back to the summary
statistics, that's a really low salary.

142
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,180
Why is it so low?

143
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,350
Well, because it's the predicted salary
for someone who just graduated and

144
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,080
has no publications and is male.
because I coded male as zero.

145
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,310
Okay.

146
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,486
So that's how to interpret the regression
constant in this example.

147
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:29,478
What's 502?
Well, 502 was

148
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:34,580
the regression coefficient for
publications.

149
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,090
So, you might say, well, okay, that's,

150
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,450
that's for a one unit increase in
publications,

151
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,350
that's the predicted change in salary.
And that's almost right.

152
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,890
Because that's what we learned in simple
regression, right.

153
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,930
The regression coefficient is for a one
unit

154
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,440
increase in X, it's the predicted change
in Y.

155
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,000
It's the slope relating X to Y.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,425
But, what you have to remember in a
multiple regression.

157
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:07,220
Is that there are other variables floating
around

158
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,310
in this model.

159
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,120
So, it's the slope relating publications
to salary, yes.

160
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,530
But it's the slope at the average level of

161
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,780
time since PHD and averaging across men
and women.

162
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,470
So it's taking into account those other
variables in

163
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,300
your model which can get tricky and fool
you if

164
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,700
you're not careful in interpreting a
regression coefficient.

165
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,080
So example, who makes more money, men or
women?

166
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,560
Well if you look at the P value it's not
significant.

167
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,180
And it's negative.
So, if you go back and look at the table

168
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,520
of coefficients, it was at negative 3000
something, I coded men

169
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,860
as zero, women as one.
So, a one unit in increase in

170
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:09,110
X means we are going from male to female.
And the predicted change is negative.

171
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,580
What that means is, who makes more money,
men or women?

172
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,310
Well, women and, I'm sorry, who makes
more?

173
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,810
Men.

174
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,770
but, there are other variables floating
around in the model.

175
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,610
Right, it's, that's the difference between
men and women for an average

176
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,480
number of years since the PhD, and an
average number of publications.

177
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,620
So who makes more money, men or women?

178
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,320
I don't know, actually.
Because I didn't look at just.

179
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,230
Average salary for men and just average

180
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,220
salary for women, I looked at it in the
context of these other variables.

181
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,930
What if all the female faculty members in
this sample were just

182
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,300
hired and their times since their PhD is
very low.

183
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,690
Then, we might get this relationship
between men and

184
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,210
women just because of other
characteristics of the sample.

185
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,760
That is, other values on the other
variables

186
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,500
that are used as predictors in the model.

187
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,550
That's where this gets tricky.

188
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:24,230
then according to this model is that
difference statistically significant?

189
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,230
If you go back to the table of
coefficients, the p

190
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,490
value's not less than 0.05, so no it's not
significantly different.

191
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,130
Does that mean there's not a significant
difference in salary between

192
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,837
men and women in the sample?
No, because

193
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:45,440
again, this is the difference between men
and women when taking into

194
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,480
account these other variables.
It's very likely, that, there are more

195
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,020
men, that have, that are at the higher end
of the distribution in terms of

196
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,290
years since PhD, alright?
Because in academia, there are more

197
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:08,460
men than women, especially years ago.
So, if we took that variable out

198
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,820
and just looked at the difference between
men and women, it might be significant.

199
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,470
So that's where this gets really tricky.

200
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,220
The final question, what's the strongest
predictor of salary?

201
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,210
Well, time since Ph.D, I sort of gave that
away at the beginning.

202
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,950
But how do we know for sure?

203
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,320
You have to

204
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,640
look at the standardized regression
coefficient.

205
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,140
Now, the unstandardized, because the
unstandardized is

206
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,310
linked to the scale of each predictor

207
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,110
right, so to compare different predictors
you

208
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,880
have to look at the standardized
regression coefficient.

209
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,378
That's why I added that column so we could
answer this question.

210
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:49,060
That had the highest standardized.
The regression coefficient.

211
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,150
So that's why time is the strongest
predictor.

212
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,210
So to wrap up this segment again just

213
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,780
understand the components of the, the
regression equation.

214
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,400
Which I think, should be clear by now.

215
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,560
but more importantly.

216
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,320
Maybe walk through this lecture a couple
times, to make sure you understand

217
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,760
how to interpret the regression
coefficients when

218
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,690
there are multiple predictors in the
model.

219
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,700
Because it can get tricky.
And we'll do more examples of this in lab.

220
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,320
And next week, in the context of
moderation and mediation.
