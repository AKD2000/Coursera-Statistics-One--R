1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,540
Hi, welcome back to Statistics One.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,530
We're up to lecture four, and the topic in
lecture four is summary statistics.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,566
So in the last lecture we talked about
distributions

4
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:19,280
and the importance of looking at
distributions in histograms.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,213
In this lecture we'll talk about the
importance of summarizing all

6
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:28,200
that information in just some talking
points that we call" summary statistics".

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,000
So this lecture is divided into just two
segments.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,744
First, I'll talk about measures of central
tendency and

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,890
in the second segment I'll talk about
measures of variability.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,940
So this first segment, let's look at
measures of central tendency.

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,120
To do this, again we're going to go wine
tasting.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,200
Makes this a little bit more fun.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,052
Remember we had this example from the last
lecture, where we had 100 wine experts.

14
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:00,892
Rate, like overall quality of eight
different

15
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:03,590
wines; four red wines, four white wines.

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,280
And again, higher scores indicated higher
quality.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,351
Now, we might want to ask well which

18
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:14,420
country had the highest overall wine
rating?

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,004
That was important to us as we were doing

20
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,310
this we wanted to see how this would come
out.

21
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,340
And just for the record, to be clear, we
did this completely randomly.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,450
So my assistant David, who is from France,
and I, we to be fair we just said let's

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,020
generate this completely randomly so that
we're not biased

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,190
and so that we don't insult people around
the world.

25
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,400
a funny thing happened, David actually did
this, he generated random numbers.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,453
He came back to my office with a really
sad look on his

27
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:47,967
face, and he said," France-lost do we
really have to do this randomly?

28
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:48,606
[LAUGH]

29
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:52,102
and I said," Yes, we do have to do this
randomly".

30
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:55,434
so let's look at the overall rankings if
we just want to look

31
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:59,230
at the average, and let's just stick with
the reds for now.

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,760
Here are the means that we calculated from
the data that we generated.

33
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:11,560
so the mean for the Argentinian Malbec was
66.73.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,373
The mean for the Australian Shiraz

35
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:16,254
was 81.76.

36
00:02:16,254 --> 00:02:22,610
the mean for the French red I forget what
the French red was, was 70.97.

37
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,218
And for USA, it was a Cabernet, it was

38
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:33,230
76.38.
So, in this simulation, Australia won.

39
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,120
Okay, again, this is completely random.
we did not fix this.

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,385
But how do we calculate

41
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:43,310
the mean?
And, hopefully, this is review to you.

42
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,158
But again, this is a, this is supposed

43
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:47,910
to be an introduction, very first course
in statistics.

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,870
So if you're not familiar, The way we did
this is we, we plugged the numbers into r.

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,910
But if we wanted to do this by hand.

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,004
All we would have to do is take all of the
ratings from the

47
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:04,611
100 wine experts, just put them in a
column, sum that entire column and

48
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:08,680
then divide the sum by the number of
ratings.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,180
So that's the formula right here.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,540
So it's the formula for the mean or
average.

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,890
Is just the sum of all the scores divided
by the number of scores.

52
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,720
Okay?
So just sum of x, over n, is the mean.

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,820
And these are the means for the red ro,
red wines

54
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,150
across those, four countries.

55
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,520
Now, lets consider the white wines.

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,056
So which country won, with respect to the
whites, again, this is totally random, I

57
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,072
didn't bias this, even though I had a

58
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:45,718
favourite in the race, and that favourite
won.

59
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:46,762
[LAUGH]

60
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:51,790
so, the US, the Rieslings from upstate New
York.

61
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,260
[LAUGH]

62
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,964
The cameraman's waving hey.
again, this was not, this

63
00:03:57,964 --> 00:04:02,483
was not biased, this was totally random.
just slightly one.

64
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:06,673
Right?
So it were, it just slightly beat out

65
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:13,871
Australia and France, for the overall
average, ranking.

66
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,551
But again, let's go back to the topic of
this,

67
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:21,220
this segment.
It's measures of central tendency.

68
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,130
The mean or average, is the most popular
measure of central tendency.

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,890
A, a, it's a very common summary
statistic,

70
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,260
I think most of you are familiar with it.

71
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,560
So, to be clear, what do I mean by a
measure of central tendency?

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,010
It's just a measure or a summary
statistic.

73
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,782
That describes the middle point, or is

74
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:50,130
representative of the middle point of a
distribution.

75
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,400
So it should be representative of the
distribution as a whole.

76
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,290
Of course, we can't describe the whole
distribution with one number.

77
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,570
Right?

78
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,590
This is just what statisticians call a
point estimate.

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,430
But it should do a pretty good job, it
should be representative.

80
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,772
The most common examples of measures of
central tendency

81
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:15,190
in statistics are the mean, the median and
the mode.

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,140
So, the mean we saw is just sum up all the
scores, divide by the number of scores.

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,100
It's the mean or the average.

84
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,760
The median is just the middle score in a
distribution.

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,053
So if I just lined up all of the rankings,
all

86
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:33,236
of the ratings on the wines, from the
highest ranking to

87
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:38,487
the lowest ranking, and just plucked out
the middle ranking, say the

88
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:44,090
50th ranking out of the 100, that would be
my median, ranking.

89
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,520
And the mode is easy.

90
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,615
That's just the score that occurs most
often in the distribution, and if now

91
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:55,310
that you've seen histograms and know how
to plot histograms, it's real easy to see.

92
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,240
Just look for the peak of the histogram.
That's the mode.

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,449
That's why that one non-normal
distribution that we talked about, in

94
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,590
the last lecture was called bi-modal
because it had two peaks.

95
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,180
So, if there are two peaks there are two
modes.

96
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,860
Sometimes there's more than one mode.

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,304
So the mean or the average, is by far the

98
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:20,370
most common measure of central tendency
used insti, in statistics.

99
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,942
It's the one we're going to rely on the
most in this course.

100
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:27,880
in any intro stats course, that's the one
that you're going to rely on the most.

101
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,100
so for example, the red, red wine ratings,

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,938
another classic example is just your grade
point average.

103
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:39,360
If you want to know how well you're doing
in school, or how well you're

104
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,260
doing acr, across all your Coursera
classes, I'm hoping

105
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,550
that maybe you're taking more than one
Coursera class.

106
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,930
You could get your grade point average.

107
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,910
Your average across all of your courses.

108
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,940
and there are lots more examples.

109
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,960
They're just averages or means that we can
take.

110
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,450
And those are the, the mean is the best
when you have a normal distribution.

111
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,210
If you don't have a normal distribution.

112
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,440
In particular, if you have a distribution
with really extreme scores.

113
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,484
So an extreme positive skew or an extreme
negative skew, then

114
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:17,359
you might rather go with the median,
rather than the mean.

115
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:22,518
And that's because those few extreme
scores can really bias the mean, whereas

116
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:27,060
the median, if you just line the scores
up, and take the middle one.

117
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,735
Those extreme scores are not going to buy
us the

118
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:34,330
median as much as they're going to buy us
the mean.

119
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,474
So we can look at the white wine ratings

120
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:40,180
as an example of that, but those weren't
that skewed.

121
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,080
So we'll look at them.

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,550
So you won't see a big difference between

123
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,556
the mean and median, you'll see a slight
difference.

124
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:49,336
another example is a classic example right
now in, in

125
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:53,536
the US, and, and lots of modern countries
right now,

126
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:58,066
is household income.
So, household income, particularly in the

127
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:04,200
US right now particularly in Brazil right
now is really not normally distributed.

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,744
So there's a real positive skew in, in
the, income distributions in

129
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:15,570
the US and in other countires as well, and
we'll take a look at that as well.

130
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,578
So, you'll often see reported in the news
or if you're

131
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:21,960
reading stuff on the internet, you'll
often hear.

132
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,520
Median salary, or median household income
reported, rather than

133
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,350
mean salary, or average salary, or average
household income.

134
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,480
And that's because those distributions are
skewed.

135
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,360
So first, let's look at the, the wine
ratings again.

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,509
These are the white wine ratings.

137
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:46,280
because remember, these one, these are the
ones that were not normally distributed.

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,760
I want to draw your attention to the
Australian distribution.

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,130
Remember, it was slightly positively
skewed.

140
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,864
This isn't a real strong skew.

141
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:59,370
We'll see, we'll see a stronger one in the
income distribution in a moment.

142
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:06,620
and then remember the US distribution had
this slight negative skew.

143
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:15,410
So if we look at the means and the
medians, the summary and statistics,

144
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,346
the measures of central tendency for these
wines; you'll see

145
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:27,670
that there's a slight shift in the
Australian one, and in the US.

146
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,586
For Australia, the median is slightly
lower than the mean,

147
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:41,380
because the median is less influenced by
those extreme scores.

148
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,656
The extreme scores in, in the Australian
case

149
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:47,770
were on the high end of the distribution.

150
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,490
Right?

151
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,810
It was positively skewed.

152
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,380
So the median is less influenced by those
really high ratings.

153
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,924
Therefore, the median is going to be
slightly lower than the mean in a

154
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:07,620
positively skewed distribution like the
Australian whites.

155
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,310
The opposite is true in the US white wine
rating distribution.

156
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,100
So, in that case, there was a slight

157
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,690
negative skew, so those negative, those
extreme negative

158
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,800
ratings are going to, have less of an
influence on the median.

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,000
So here, the median is going to be
slightly higher than the mean.

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,772
Again, because those low rankings are
going to have less

161
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:35,510
[INAUDIBLE]

162
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,750
of an influence on the median than they do
on the mean.

163
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,270
So the median is going to be slightly

164
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,710
higher in a negatively skewed
distribution, than the mean.

165
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,360
And we see that in the rankings for the US
white.

166
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,074
Here's a more detailed graphic.

167
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,070
again, this one I just took off the
internet.

168
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,480
This is a histogram of household income in
the United States.

169
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,387
It shows this really extremely positively
skewed distribution.

170
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:11,853
Okay?

171
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:15,831
Here you are going to see a large
difference between measures

172
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:20,480
of central tendency like the mean, the
median and the mode.

173
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,974
Okay, so if I just took the average of all
of these incomes, we're going to have to

174
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:29,664
average in these extremely high incomes
way up here,

175
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:33,610
which are, you know, this isn't even that
high.

176
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,715
The graph actually extends way beyond that
to include

177
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:40,882
people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg
and so on.

178
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:45,698
right, if I include their salaries in the
mean, the mean is really

179
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:47,400
going to be inflated.

180
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,984
In contrast, if I just take the median,

181
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:53,100
the middle score, that's going to be right
here,

182
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,368
no matter whether I include Mark
Zuckerberg, Bill

183
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:59,880
Gates, people like that, in my
distribution or not.

184
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:10,154
the median is still going to fall right
here, it's at about $49,445.

185
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:10,734
And if

186
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:17,114
you look at this the mode is actually
right about here that's

187
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:22,941
way down between like, say, 15 and 20,000.
Okay?

188
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:27,130
So when you have this extremely skewed
distribution like this.

189
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,960
Like US household income right now, over
the last few years in particular.

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,980
You're going to get a real difference
between the mean, the median, and

191
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,080
the mode.

192
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,512
Because it's hard to find a measure of

193
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:44,440
central tendency that's representative of
the entire group, right?

194
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,224
That's part of the problem.

195
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,290
I'm not going to get into a political
discussion about this.

196
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,775
it's just a good example to illustrate a
non-normal distribution, and how

197
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,985
measures of central tendency can really

198
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:59,390
differ when you have non-normal
distributions.

199
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,142
If it was perfectly normal,

200
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:05,540
then the mean and the median, and the mode
would be just about the same.

201
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,729
So finally, the mode is just the peak of

202
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:15,469
a histogram, it's just the score that
occurs most often.

203
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:19,069
So, the Argentina white wine distribution,
that was

204
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:21,530
a real easy one to look at the peak.

205
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,738
Remember, because it was, it was
leptokurtic.

206
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,570
it had that really strong peak.

207
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,530
If you look back at the graph, it was
right around 70 to 72.

208
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,184
It was also about the average.

209
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:34,640
because it didn't have really

210
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,472
extreme rankings on the negative end or on
the positive end.

211
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:43,410
a thing about the mode is it can also be
applied to nominal variables.

212
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,110
That's not true of the mean or the median.

213
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,030
Alright, but we can apply it to nominal
variables.

214
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,315
So, what I did for fun, is I just took
these countries

215
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:59,717
that we've been playing with the US,
France, Argentina, Australia, and I just

216
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:02,199
said, well in the last year what were the

217
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:05,772
most common, or what of the model baby
names.

218
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:09,690
this really surprised me, I don't know if
my source is accurate.

219
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:16,305
but, in the, in the US, the most common
female baby name in the last year is

220
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:24,285
Sophia, most common male name is James in
France it's Emma and Nathan in Argentina,

221
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:26,740
it's Sofia and Juan.

222
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,440
And in Australia, it's Charlotte and
Oliver.

223
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,740
Those are the model baby names.
They're the ones that occur most often.

224
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,110
It's only the mode that we can apply to
nominal variables.

225
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,120
We can't apply the average.

226
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,760
For example, two nominal variables or the
median to nominal variables.

227
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,940
So, to sum up this segment,

228
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,525
[INAUDIBLE]

229
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:50,390
we're talking about summary statistics.

230
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,870
Some of the most common summary statistics
are measures of central tendency.

231
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,490
By far, the most common is the mean, or
average, but we might want to use

232
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,339
the median, particularly in cases where we

233
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:06,862
have skewed distributions with, with
really, extreme outliers.

234
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,834
and some cases we might want to just look
at

235
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,360
the mode which is the score that occurs
most often.
