1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,125
Hi, welcome back.
We're up to Lecture 4, Segment 2.

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,369
And in this lecture, we're talking about
summary statistics.

3
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:12,469
And in this segment, in particular,

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,194
we're going to talk about measures of
variability.

5
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:19,703
So what do I mean by variability and
measures of variability.

6
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:22,223
Well, in the last segment, we talked about
measures of

7
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:25,949
central tendency, like the mean, the
median or the mode.

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,465
What those measures do is they try to
capture

9
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:33,569
the center point of a distribution.
What measures of variability

10
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:38,715
do is they try to capture how much spread,
or how much of a dis, how wide is

11
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:43,777
the distribution.
So, the two main measures

12
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:48,582
that we'll look at are standard deviation
and variance.

13
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,523
And variance is simply standard deviation
squared.

14
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:53,720
So standard deviation

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,852
is just the average deviation from the
mean in a distribution.

16
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:00,776
And we'll see that mathematically in a
moment.

17
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:06,571
And again, variance is standard deviation
squared.

18
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,025
So this is an important formula to know.

19
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:14,002
I'm assuming that most of you already knew
the formula for a mean.

20
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,857
And if you didn't know it already, it's
all right.

21
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:17,009
It's easy to remember.

22
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,018
Remember, it's just the sum of the scores
divided

23
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:23,105
by the number of scores.
So sum of x divided by n.

24
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,956
This formula is just in, just as important
to know.

25
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:28,673
You should know this off, off the top of
your head.

26
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:32,944
the formula for standard deviation and for
variance.

27
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:34,613
It's very similar.

28
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:39,943
It's just now we're going to get the sum
of deviation scores squared.

29
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:41,651
That's known as the sum of squared

30
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,887
deviance scores, or for short sum of
squares.

31
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,556
And divide that by n.

32
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,055
And I'll walk you through the math, so you
get familiar with

33
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:53,438
this, because this is a really important
concept going forward in statistics.

34
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,352
Just knowing how to calculate standard

35
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:59,274
deviation and variance, and understanding
them conceptually.

36
00:01:59,274 --> 00:01:59,885
Okay.

37
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:03,449
So, if this is new to you, please spend a
lot of time reviewing this

38
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:09,789
segment, so that you get this, this, the
math down and you get the concept down.

39
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,409
And just a word about variance before I
dive into the math and an example,

40
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:18,490
is that sometimes, especially in
psychology and sociology

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,037
or political science, variance gets a bad
wrap.

42
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:28,245
So, like I study individual differences in
intelligence, for example.

43
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:31,332
And a lot of times, people think, oh,
well, it's so horrible

44
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:34,986
that this child has scored so, so poorly
on this intelligence test, or

45
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:39,906
so on.
but it's always important in statistics to

46
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:46,601
remember that variation is natural and
it's good, it's information in statistics.

47
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,998
So, look at variance with a very positive
view if

48
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:55,438
you can, because it's, it's, as I said,
it's natural.

49
00:02:55,438 --> 00:03:00,098
And the way to think of it in statistics
is variance is information.

50
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:06,771
It's going to allow for us to investigate
co-variants and correlation and so on.

51
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:09,907
So, and if, if you don't trust me or if
I'm not convincing you

52
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:15,238
enough that variance is natural and
variance is good check out the guy named

53
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:15,738
[UNKNOWN].

54
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:21,379
He, he thought that he's pretty good.
so, onto an example.

55
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,643
There is one of my favorite examples I
developed last year

56
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:29,941
because this happened in New York city,
which is where I live.

57
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:35,881
and it happened in professional basketball
in the US in the MBA.

58
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:38,471
this is a guy called Jeremy Lin, who was
not

59
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:42,839
that big of a star, not a star at all
actually.

60
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:46,345
He's not really a top basketball player in
the US.

61
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:50,517
but all of a sudden, he got the chance to
play for the New York Knicks.

62
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:53,663
so there's Jeremy Lin in Madison Square
Garden.

63
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:55,223
That's right there in the middle of
Manhattan,

64
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,523
just a couple of blocks from where I live.

65
00:03:57,523 --> 00:04:01,838
so, I got caught up in what the media
called Linsanity.

66
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,043
Jeremy Lin suddenly took the NBA by storm,

67
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,570
because he started scoring a lot of
points.

68
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:07,960
so what

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,910
we're going to do is we're going to look
at

70
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,908
Jeremy Lin's points per game over that
time.

71
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:18,059
it was during the winter of 2012.

72
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:25,144
so what I can do is, I can look at Jeremy
Lin's points per game across, let's just

73
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:32,783
pick out a 10 game stretch of that season
in 2012.

74
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:38,818
And if you start at the bottom, actually,
you'll see there's just 2 points per game

75
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:44,381
in that one game.
And that was typical of what Jeremy

76
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:50,077
Lin was doing before one of the star
players on the Knicks was hurt, and Jeremy

77
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:55,329
Lin had the opportunity to play.

78
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,729
So Carmelo Anthony, who is one of the
stars of the

79
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,695
New York Knicks, he was hurt, Jeremy Lin
got the opportunity to start.

80
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:07,723
In his first opportunity to start, he
scored 25 points.

81
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:14,991
And then the next time he, he, he started,
he scored 28 points, and so on.

82
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,492
He scored 23.

83
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:18,685
And I think it was around here when he
scored 38, that

84
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,721
Linsanity totally set in in New York City
and we got all excited.

85
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:27,144
We thought the Knicks were going to win
the NBA championship, it never happened.

86
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,546
not happening again.

87
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:30,534
Today as I filmed this the NBA game

88
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:35,572
seven championship is happening tonight
here in the US.

89
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,540
and the Knicks aren't in it

90
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,893
[LAUGH].

91
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:44,160
that is the topic of this lecture.

92
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,594
we have Jeremy Lin's points per game
across 10 games.

93
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:51,379
We can get summary statistics from this.
Right?

94
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,929
So we can get, what was his average across

95
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:58,362
this, this segment, or this section of the
season.

96
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:00,549
So what was his average across these 10
games?

97
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:03,387
And that's a common statistic in a lot of
sports.

98
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:03,642
So,

99
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:08,572
points per game, or say goals per season
if you're looking at football

100
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:15,838
internationally, or hockey here in the US
is also big right now.

101
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:20,041
so we could get just average points per
game.

102
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:24,136
But I also might want to know, and, and
it, it's an important statistic to look at

103
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,215
if you're looking at sort of the quality

104
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,987
of players, is how variable are these
players across

105
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:32,801
a certain stretch of games.

106
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:36,695
So, was Jeremy Lin consistent across these
10 games, or was he sort of all

107
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:42,606
over the place, having a good night one
night, a bad night the next night?

108
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:45,361
So first, let's calculate the mean.

109
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:49,037
That's just the sum of all the scores
divided by n.

110
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:53,730
And I did that down at the bottom of the
screen here.

111
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,120
To get

112
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,357
the mean, I just sum that column of points
per game.

113
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:03,426
The sum of that column is 227, or
averaging over 10 games.

114
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:08,371
So it's 227 over 10, or 22.7.

115
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:14,417
So during that 10 game stretch, Jeremy Lin
is averaging 22.7 points per game.

116
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:17,990
That's the mean, that's a measure of
central tendency.

117
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,236
But we want to know

118
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:23,355
about his variability over those 10 games.

119
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:28,864
So, the way to calculate variability is
variance and standard deviation.

120
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,817
The first thing we want to do is for each

121
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:35,178
game, we want to calculate what's known as
a deviation score.

122
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:42,477
And that's this column.
These are deviation scores.

123
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,493
So to get a deviation score, I just

124
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:48,813
take how many points did Jeremy Lin score
in one game and compare it to his

125
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:54,724
average.
So, in this first row, I can take 28 and

126
00:07:54,724 --> 00:08:00,583
subtract his average 22.7 and I get 5.3.

127
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,574
So he was deviating from his average about
5.3.

128
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:10,125
He was 5.3 above average that night.
And so on, I can calculate

129
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,159
each deviation score.

130
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:18,554
The whole point of variability is getting
sort of an average deviation.

131
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:24,768
Now, I can't take the average of this
column because it sums to zero.

132
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:30,146
So, if I sum that column, I would get zero
and divide by 10, I'd have zero.

133
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:34,810
So, instead what we'll do is we'll square
each deviation score,

134
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:40,819
that's this last column, is the deviation
scores squared.

135
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:45,016
That gets rid of sign.
So then when I sum the squared deviation

136
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:49,420
scores, I can divide by n and that gives
me variance.

137
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,979
So, this last column, I've just taken each
deviations score,

138
00:08:54,979 --> 00:09:00,211
squared it and then sum all this squared
deviation scores

139
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:05,211
to get 922.1.
If divide

140
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,216
by 10, that gives me 92.21.

141
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:15,256
So, to summarize those results, his
average points per game or mean

142
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:20,122
was 22.7.
The variance standard deviation squared

143
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:26,200
was that 92.21, it was the sum of squared
deviations divided by n.

144
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,626
For short, we're going to call that sum of
squares divided by n.

145
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:36,290
If we take the square root of that, then
we get the standard deviation, 9.6.

146
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,833
By taking the square root, that brings us
back to the units that we started in.

147
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,230
Remember, we had to square everything to
get rid of sine,

148
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,131
when we went from deviation scores to
square of deviation scores.

149
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,336
So this last step, we take the square
root,

150
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,226
that brings us back to the units we we

151
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:54,261
in, which is points per game.

152
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:59,723
What this is saying is on average, he was
fluctuating about 10 points per game.

153
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:04,499
Is that really accurate?
Not really.

154
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,683
He wasn't really fluctuating about ten
points per

155
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:09,393
game, once he had the opportunity to
start.

156
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:10,495
Right?

157
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:13,267
The standard deviation is 9.6, because I
included

158
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,743
that one game where he only scored 2
points.

159
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,763
He didn't start that game.

160
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:26,053
If we don't include that, then his
standard deviation will go down.

161
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:29,338
before I do that, I just want to point out
some notation.

162
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,236
Again, I'm going to use M for mean,

163
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:35,550
SD for standard deviation, SD squared for
variance.

164
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,046
It's also known as mean squares for the

165
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:42,792
mean sum of squares, er, mean squared
deviations.

166
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:48,360
so mean squares, sum of squares, these are
important definitions to know

167
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,101
going forward.
but again, let's look at Lin, and compare

168
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:59,632
him to one of the top stars in the NBA,
Kobe Bryant.

169
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:03,510
I guess after this year, I might have to
do LeBron James.

170
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,047
But I just can't, I don't like him.
I'm not really a big fan of Kobe either,

171
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:11,238
but I'm sticking with Kobe.

172
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:16,814
let's compare Jeremy Lin during that time
in the winter of 2012 to what Kobe Bryant

173
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:22,252
was doing during that time in the winter
of 2012.

174
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:27,561
Kobe Bryant was the leading scorer at the
time in the League.

175
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:33,055
So, if we take the 10 games that I just
looked at for Jeremy Lin and we compare 10

176
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:39,305
games from Kobe Bryant during that same
stretch of time.

177
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:40,773
This is R output.

178
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:42,798
You're now familiar with this after going
through the

179
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:46,267
first lab, and hopefully you're working on
the first homework.

180
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:52,757
what you see is, here's the mean for Lin,
and here's the mean for Bryant.

181
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:55,874
so Jeremy Lin was averaging 22.7.

182
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:58,512
We just showed you how to calculate that
by hand.

183
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:00,465
You won't have to do that, just plug it
into R.

184
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,175
R will give you the mean.

185
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,148
It's 22.7.

186
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:07,815
he wasn't really doing quite as well as
Kobe Bryant.

187
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:12,688
Kobe Bryant was averaging 26.4 points per
game.

188
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:19,110
but if we look at a measure of variation.
So, let's

189
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,904
look at the measure of standard deviation.
as we saw in our hand calculations,

190
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:28,120
Jeremy Lin's standard deviation's about 10
points per game, whereas Kobe

191
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,970
Bryant's is only about 7 and a half points
per game.

192
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,378
But again, that's because I included that
one game where he had

193
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:41,855
just two points in that game, and he
didn't start that game.

194
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,949
So, let's compare Kobe Bryant and Jeremy
Lin if I drop that one out.

195
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,199
So here's the R output if we just look

196
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,245
at 9 games during that stretch.

197
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:56,019
And in these 9 games, Jeremy Lin started
all 9 games.

198
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:03,037
Now, he's doing almost as well as Kobe
Bryant, 25 points per games versus 26.6.

199
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:08,611
And his variability is about the same.
So now,

200
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:14,076
it's about 7 and a half to about 7.8.

201
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:18,310
He's actually more consistent than Kobe
Bryant across those 9 games,

202
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,294
in that one little stretch of time in the
winter of 2012.

203
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:28,779
It was wonderful back then for us, us
Knicks fans it didn't last long.

204
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:31,099
but that's the point of, of this

205
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:36,305
little illustration, is to look summary
statistics.

206
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:39,455
We can get something that's very common we
know about,

207
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,388
is the average or mean, but we can also
look at variability.

208
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:49,554
How consistent are the scores in a
distribution, or how variable are

209
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:54,724
the scores in a distribution.
And that's the point

210
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:59,927
of calculating standard deviation and
variance.

211
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:04,888
so to review this entire lecture.
the point of summary

212
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:09,425
statistics is, we can't always show our
audience.

213
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:14,661
Or when we're writing things, writing up
research for a, a publication in a

214
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:20,264
journal or an article in a newspaper, or
on a website.

215
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:23,989
we can't show all of those histograms for
all our variables.

216
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:29,485
It just become too much information for
the audience to digest.

217
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:30,115
So, we often

218
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:34,212
want to just give some talking points,
some summary statistics.

219
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:38,856
And the most common summary statistics are
measures of central tendency.

220
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:41,421
And the most common one of those is the
mean or average,

221
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:46,738
but you might want to do median in the
case of extremely skewed distributions.

222
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:48,629
but it's also really important as you

223
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,496
start getting into statistics and really
important for

224
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:55,339
the rest of this course, to think beyond
just the mean or measures of central

225
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:00,434
tendency and think about measures of
variability.

226
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:04,258
Variance is going to be a really important
concept as we move forward.

227
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:06,146
So it's important that you understand

228
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:09,398
how to calculate standard deviation and
variance.

229
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:15,093
And it's important that you understand
conceptually what standard, deviation

230
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:20,435
and mean, and what they convey.
Finally, it's important

231
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:26,708
that you know the following formulas and
that you can just do these by hand.

232
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:31,447
Of course, we're going to do all our
calculations using the R software.

233
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,710
it's less error-prone and a lot faster
and, and convenient.

234
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,245
Right?

235
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:39,554
But you should just know how to do these
off the top of your head.

236
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:42,425
So, again, hopefully this one was review.

237
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:46,233
If it's not, just give yourselves some
practice on it.

238
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:50,693
so the mean is just the sum of all the
scores divided by the number of scores.

239
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:55,682
And then, I gave you this one formula for
standard deviation and variance.

240
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:59,327
this first one is used for descriptive
statistics.

241
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:03,393
And that's still all we're dealing with is
descriptive statistics.

242
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:06,921
We're just describing what's going on in a
sample.

243
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,809
Next week, when we move to inferential

244
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:11,287
statistics, we're going to use a slightly
different

245
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,588
formula for variance and standard
deviation,

246
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:16,803
where we'll divide by n minus 1.

247
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:20,393
And we'll talk about that when we go into
inferential statistics.

248
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:22,603
And if you are very sharp, you will notice

249
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:25,853
that the standard deviation I calculated
by hand for Jeremy

250
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,453
Lin's points for gain was not exactly the
same as

251
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:33,701
the standard deviation that we saw in the
R output.

252
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,581
And that's because I used the formula for
descriptive

253
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:41,973
statistics, I divided by n because that's
all I was doing, was descriptive.

254
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:43,491
But the default in R is to use

255
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:47,121
the inferential formula, dividing by n
minus 1.

256
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:51,002
And that's why there's that slight
discrepancy, if you picked up on it.

257
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:53,090
and that's the end of that segment.
