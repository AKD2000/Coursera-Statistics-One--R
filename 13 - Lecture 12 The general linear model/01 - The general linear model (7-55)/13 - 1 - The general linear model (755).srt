00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,070
Hi.
Welcome back to Statistics One.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,380
We're up to lecture 12, and in the last
lecture we talked about multiple

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,100
regression which is one of the more

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,040
difficult topics that we'll cover in this
course.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,960
And in the next two lectures, lectures 13
and 14,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,240
will cover advanced techniques in multiple
regression, moderation, and mediation.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,250
Before we do that.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,920
I want to take a step back, and

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,800
just talk about the mathematical frame
work underlying

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,100
all of these approaches.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,660
And that is called the general linear
model.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,660
So the topic for today in lecture 12, is
GLM or General Linear model.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,360
I've divided this lecture into two
segments.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,050
First I'll talk about the generally linear
model.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,930
And then in the second segment I'll talk
about sort of more tedious details.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,920
procedure called dumby coding.
So in this

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,000
first segment lets talk about the GLM.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,630
As I said, it's a mathematical framework
that underlies multiple regression.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,240
But also analysis of variance, which is a

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,090
topic that we'll get to after multiple
regression.

21
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:14,261
a lot of people think of those two topics
as separate, so multiple regression

22
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:19,183
is often taught in one course and then
ANOVA is taught in another course.

23
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:20,030
But analysis

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,958
of variance, or ANOVA, is Just a special
case of multiple regression, and

25
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:30,158
you'll see how that's, or why that's the
case here when I talk about the GLM.

26
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:35,242
So there are two main characteristics of
the General Linear model and that

27
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:38,358
is one, that we assume linear
relationships

28
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:42,190
between the predictors and the outcome
measure.

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,650
That is between the Xs and Y and

30
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,410
we assume that the effects of each
predictor are additive with one another.

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,380
But that doesn't mean that the GLM can't
handle non-additive or non-linear effects.

32
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,920
We can sort of trick the GLM to test those
kind of effects.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,560
For us and that's what we were going to

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,550
do next week when we do moderation for
example.

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,980
We will trick the GLM into testing for a
non-additive effect

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,160
or a moderating effect or an ANOVA will
call that an interaction.

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,090
So the GLM can accommodate such tests.
for example non-linear relations

38
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,630
we could just transform variables to make
them linear and then fit it into the GLM.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,356
and as I said we can add in interaction
terms or moderation terms.

40
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:44,110
So that we can do a moderation analysis
and test for non-additive.

41
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,890
Added of facts.

42
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,930
So, let's look at a few examples, this
will

43
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,210
help make this more concrete and explained
the general framework.

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,660
So, when we looked at a simple regression,
we just

45
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,360
had one predictor, one outcome so faculty
salary was the outcome.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,540
And years since PHD was the predictor.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,450
We could do a multiple regression, and add
in other predictors.

48
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,110
So we

49
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,670
added in we had years since the PHD.

50
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,810
And then we also added in number of
publications.

51
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,300
but we could add in a third predictor

52
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,530
that's the product of those first 2
predictors.

53
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,040
And that would allow us to test for
non-additive effects.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,470
It would allow us to see if number of

55
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,970
publications moderates the relationship
between year since PhD and salary.

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,720
And you might think that's, that's the
case, so

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,400
perhaps like number of publications
matters a lot more.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,870
For a determined salary earlier in your
career rather than later.

59
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,350
So, there might be an interaction or
moderation effect.

60
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,650
If that were the case, then that predictor
x3, that would

61
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,110
be a significant predictor of the outcome
measure of faculty salary.

62
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,990
But this is a way that the GLM

63
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:10,890
can handle testing non additive effects.
Notice the GLM, the equation itself,

64
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,530
is still linear and additive, but I'm
tricking it by throwing in X3,

65
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,270
a non additive effect.
So, that's how it accomodates.

66
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,590
These things, and that's how we're, that's
what we're going

67
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,730
to do next week, when we talk about
moderation analysis.

68
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,170
This is the same exact logic underlying
one-way ANOVA

69
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,875
and factorial ANOVA, which we'll get to
following moderation.

70
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,300
Its just that we do ANOVA's sort have been
a special

71
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,930
case where we have categorical predictors
rather than these continuous predictors.

72
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,890
So I might predict faculty salary from say
just

73
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,380
gender that's a categorical predictor and
its a nominal variable.

74
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,910
That's different from, like, number of
years since the PhD, or

75
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,610
number of publications, where we can

76
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,260
assume a nice continuous normal
distribution.

77
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,850
That's a different, this is a different
case.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,200
So, when we have categorical predictors,
we'll do ANOVA.

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,030
And, just as we did with the multiple
regression, testing

80
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,960
for moderation effects, we can test for
interaction effects, and ANOVA.

81
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,280
So, I could put in gender as one

82
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,810
predictor, race as another predictor,
again, a categorical predictor.

83
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,400
And then for X3, the third predictor, I
could look at the interaction

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,270
of gender and race and do, does that
interaction effect Predict faculty salary.

85
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,050
Again notice the glm itself is linear and
additive and

86
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,610
it's just handling categorical predictors
here and that's why it's an

87
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,690
ANOVA, and it's a factorial ANOVA because
we have multiple predictors.

88
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,100
So we'll get to analysis of variance,
after

89
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,390
we cover these other topics in multiple
regression.

90
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,240
That is moderation, and mediation.

91
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,420
It's most appropriate for situations where
we have true independent variables.

92
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,870
Go back to the first week of the, of the
course,

93
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,200
where we talked about the difference

94
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,310
between experimental research and
correlational research.

95
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,920
we typically reserve analysis of variants
for situations

96
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,840
where we're doing experimental research,
where there's true independent variable.

97
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,510
but we can use it in any case where we
have categorical predictors.

98
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,000
And if there's only 2 levels of
categorical

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,790
predictors, like, think of the the polio
vaccine example,

100
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,980
where the children were just given, either
vaccine

101
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,870
or placebo, then we could just do a
t-test.

102
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,270
We don't need to do this fancy analysis of
variance.

103
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,630
And we'll cover all of that After we cover
moderation and mediation.

104
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,860
I just wanted to sort of pause before we
went into that to demonstrate

105
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,580
that the general linear model accommodates
all of these kinds of analyses.

106
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,250
So, to sum up this segment, again the GLM

107
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,020
is just an underlying mathematical
framework that we're using.

108
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,400
Not only for multiple regression.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,990
But also going forward for things like
ANOVA and factorial ANOVA, and t tests.

110
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,845
And the main thing to remember about it is
that the framework itself is linear.

111
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,510
Li, linear and additive.

112
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,020
But we can trick it to test for non linear
effects.

113
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,820
Or not additive, additive effects and in

114
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,610
multiple regression we're going to call
that moderation.

115
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,122
In fact,

116
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:45,698
[UNKNOWN],

117
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,430
we're call that interaction.
