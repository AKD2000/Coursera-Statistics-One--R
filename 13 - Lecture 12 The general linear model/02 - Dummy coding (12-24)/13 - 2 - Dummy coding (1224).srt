1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,010
Hi, welcome back.
We're in lecture 12, segment 2.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,130
And in this segment, I'm going to talk
about dummy coding.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,950
It's necessary to talk about dummy coding
in the context of the general linear model

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,610
to show you how categorical predictors are
handled in this framework.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,510
And we also use it as we move forward in
more

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,000
complex multiple regression analysis, like
moderation which will be the topic

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,109
in lecture 13.
So let's examine how dummy coding works.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,170
So, dummy coding is conceptually real
easy, but it's sort

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,270
of a tedious process and students
sometimes get tripped by it.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,090
So conceptually, it's real simple, it's
just a system to code categorical

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,680
variables in a regression analysis.
So

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,050
I'm going to use an example here sticking
with the sort of faculty salary example.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,440
imagine that we had a categorical
predictor that we wanted to add into that

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,890
analysis and imagine that that categorical
predictor

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,340
is what area of research a psychology
professor engages in.

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,970
So typical psychology departments, they
have some cognitive

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,650
psychologists, some clinical
psychologists, some

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,900
social psychologists, and so on.

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,190
So imagine I can just code each professor
according to one of theses

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,690
areas or groups and then look at the
number of publications that they have.

21
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,820
So that's my dependent variable or outcome
variable in this example.

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,190
Your data frame might look something like
this.

23
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:48,064
We could have a professor ID like the
initials of the professor.

24
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:52,574
what groups are in cognitive, clinical,
developmental, whatever.

25
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:56,318
and then the number of publications that
they have.

26
00:01:56,318 --> 00:02:00,068
so assume these are like senior
professors, there's a lot

27
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:03,890
of publications so toward their end, end
of their career.

28
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,308
How are we going to code this if we wanted

29
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:11,710
to run it in a regression analysis, for
example using the LM function in R.

30
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,480
We can't put group into the LM function

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,720
because that's a character variable, or a
string variable.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,090
We need to make it a numeric variable in
some way, so that's where dummy coding

33
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:31,610
comes in.
This is a simple scheme to, put a numeric

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,700
value on each of these groups and I'm

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,480
using cognitive, as what's called the
reference group.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,580
And I did that because I'm a cognitive

37
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,600
psychologist, so for me that was easy to
remember.

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,164
That cognitive is going to get 0 across
the board, for

39
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:50,470
dummy code 1, dummy code 2 and dummy code
3.

40
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,640
So why do I have three dummy codes?
Well, because I have four levels of

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,850
my independent variable or my grouping
variable.

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,780
It's always the number of levels or number
of groups minus one.

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,270
And you make one of your groups the
reference.

44
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,020
And I decided to make cognitive the
reference.

45
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,850
just because I'm in cognitive.
And then you just code each group so, with

46
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:21,930
a one for one of the dummy codes.
So the clinical group got a 1 in D1,

47
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,880
the developmental in D2 and social in D3.

48
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,460
This make look a little bit odd and a lot
of students they, they tend to think that

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,310
you need four codes if there's four
groups, but

50
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,480
remember it's always the number of groups
minus one.

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,820
And if you think about how the regression
equation works,

52
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,970
this might start to make a little bit of
sense.

53
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,800
Now remember what's the regression
constant in a multiple regression?

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,440
It's the predicted score on the outcome
variable, when all the Xs are zero.

55
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,750
Well I now have a really meaningful group
there.

56
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,380
I have the cognitive group.

57
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,000
That's all Xs are 0, so my regression
constant is

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,560
going to be the predicted score for the
cognitive group.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,770
So let's see how that works.

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,450
I would just add those dummy codes to my
dataframe,

61
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,180
so now I have a larger dataframe, I have
three more columns.

62
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,310
So, this is what it would look like in R.

63
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,660
Then I can run, the LM.

64
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,580
Before I show you the output of that, I
just want to show you the summary

65
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,130
statistics so you know what to expect.
So it looks like the cognitive group has a

66
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,970
mean of about 93 publications, clinical
less than that, about 60,

67
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,400
developmental a little more, 103, social a
little less, 70 and so on.

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,160
Those are standard deviations and also
notice there's

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,830
a different number of professors in each
group.

70
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,530
That's going to be important in a moment.

71
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,780
So the regression model would look like
this.

72
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,600
We just put in the three dummy codes.

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,080
So now we have three predictors.

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,120
And this will allow us to look at

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,452
the pair all these pair-wise comparisons
between groups.

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,420
And here's what the output looks like.

77
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,160
So this first number here, is the
regression constant.

78
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,342
That's the predicted score,

79
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,370
when all Xs are zero.

80
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,670
So that's the predicted score for
cognitive.

81
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,320
If I go back and look at the mean for
cognitive, it was 93.31.

82
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,820
And

83
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,810
that's exactly what I get for the
regression constant.

84
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,230
It's the mean for cognitive because I made
cognitive the reference group.

85
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,370
Now what is the negative 32.64, what is
that mean for clinical?

86
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,850
Well its a one unit increase in X is
associated with

87
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,850
that much of a predicted change in Y, or a
one unit increase in X took you from

88
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,220
cognitive to clinical for D1.

89
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,280
So that means clinical has, on average, 32
publications less than cognitive,

90
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,190
and if you look back at the summary
statistics, that's about right.

91
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,760
Developmental had slightly more than
cognitive 10.19, and

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,222
social had less than cognitive, 23.
And you might want to ask, are those

93
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:27,760
differences significant?

94
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,830
Well, then you just look out here to your
P values, and you can see that

95
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,680
the difference between clinical and
cognitive is significant,

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,920
the difference between developmental and
cognitive is not significant.

97
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,920
And the difference between cognitive and
social is significant

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,490
if we're using 0.05 as our cutoff, which
is standard.

99
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,280
Now you might want to know, I want to
compare say,

100
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,330
developmental to clinical or want to
compare clinical to social.

101
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,990
So if you wanted to do that, you would

102
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,550
have to change your reference group and
rerun this.

103
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,220
Which is why we typically don't do this,
we don't take this approach if we're just

104
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,270
looking at, a cat, one categorical
predictor and

105
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,238
these pairwise comparisons, I would do a
one-way

106
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:18,580
ANOVA instead.

107
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,810
But this is a way that you can

108
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,930
code a categorical variable in a multiple
regression analysis.

109
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,910
Because as you will see next week when we
do moderation

110
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,340
we are going to have some of our
predictors are categorical some of

111
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,610
them are continuous and then we want to
put them together in

112
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,260
a moderation analysis we have to have this
sort of coding scheme.

113
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,960
you might also want to change it so that
this number is not

114
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,380
the predictive score for cognitive but
just the

115
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,880
predictive score for all professors,
across all groups.

116
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,130
That, if you wanted to do that kind of
coding, its called effects coding.

117
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,060
The first effects coding I'm going to show
you is

118
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,320
unweighted and then I'll do a weighted
effects coding.

119
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,060
So, effects coding, you'll see I, I still

120
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,370
took cognitive as my reference group and,
but you'll see now

121
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,870
I gave them negative 1s across the board
and then, for

122
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,420
the rest of the codes, which I'm calling
C1, C2, and

123
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,810
C3, now, to call them effects codes
instead of dummy codes.

124
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,900
now you'll see well what's the predicted
score when all x's are 0?

125
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,580
Well it doesn't represent any one group
but it, what it does represent is

126
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,340
the average across all these groups.

127
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,720
So if I run that and look at the
coefficients.

128
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,120
Now what's changed, is the regression
constant, it's 81.9.

129
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,338
If you look back at the summaries
statistics, the mean is about 81.6,

130
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:57,230
so it's not exactly the mean for the
entire group.

131
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,560
And the reason for that is it's
unweighted,

132
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,590
it doesn't take into account the fact that

133
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,870
there are different number of professors
in each group.

134
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,750
So, in a second, we'll do the weighted
effects coding, and

135
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,790
that would get us the exact mean, 81.69, I
think it was.

136
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,800
But now, what do these regression
coefficients, tell me?

137
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,040
Well, this one is the difference between
the overall mean and clinical.

138
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,670
And this

139
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,710
one is the difference between the overall
mean and developmental and so on.

140
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,490
And again if you wanted to know the
difference between the overall mean

141
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,745
and cognitive, then you would have to

142
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:37,640
re-code this with a difference reference
group.

143
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,640
and again if you were just looking at

144
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,570
this, this example and you just wanted to
do.

145
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,640
just ask this question, are the number of

146
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,140
qualifications are different across these
groups then you wouldn't

147
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,480
do this sort of clumsy dummy coding or
effects

148
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,630
coding you just run a one way and over.

149
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,960
Again we need the system when we have
examples like

150
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,710
we'll cover next week where we have some
categorical predictors.

151
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,630
Like this one.

152
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,060
Like group, in the same model as
continuous predictors.

153
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,560
Like years, since phd or number of
publications.

154
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,210
And then if want it, look at the mod-,
those, those two predictors

155
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,310
together in one model we're going to have
to come up with this demi-coding scheme.

156
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,970
So finally, the way that it affects
coding,

157
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,790
if you wanted to get that regression
constant

158
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,210
to be the exact mean of all the

159
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,910
professors, then you would just have to
weight each

160
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,080
of them by the number of, sorry, the
number of professors in each group.

161
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,310
So instead of negative 1, it's just
negative N for number of professors in the

162
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,300
clinical group divided by N number of

163
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,450
professors in the cognitive group and so
on.

164
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,020
Just do instead of negative 1, just do
these

165
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,040
fractions and that would get you the exact
mean which

166
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,820
is just slightly off of 81.9.

167
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,930
I didn't actually run that one but I

168
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,180
wanted to show you exactly how you would
do

169
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,950
that if you ever come across a situation
where

170
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,320
you needed to do that, that's Weighted
Effects Coding.

171
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,870
So to wrap this up, its again conceptually
really simple.

172
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,620
Its just, you have categorical variables
that are nominal, so you can't throw them

173
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,850
into GLM or into the LM function NR
because they're string variables.

174
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,400
So you have to make them numeric in some
way

175
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,020
and the classic way of doing that is
called dummy coding.

176
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,370
Where you just pick one level of

177
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,100
your independent variable, or your
categorical variable and

178
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,060
make it the reference group.
That one gets all zeroes across

179
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,680
all the codes, and then you have just as
many

180
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,030
codes as groups minus1.
And then that's it.

181
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:09,607
And that allows you to look at categorical
predictors in the same model as

182
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:14,317
continuous predictors and put them

183
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:19,498
together in moderation analyses which

184
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:24,891
is what we're going to do in lecture 13.
