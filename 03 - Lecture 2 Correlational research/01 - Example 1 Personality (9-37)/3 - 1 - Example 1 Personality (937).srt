1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,440
Hi.
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,250
We're in lecture two of Statistics One.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,190
The topic of this lecture is correlational
research.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,720
So in lecture one, we talked about
experimental research.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,680
And I made the argument about how powerful
experimental research

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,615
is because it allows us to make strong
claims about causality.

7
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:29,578
Correlational research is the opposite.
In fact it gets sort of a, a, a bad rap

8
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:33,010
because the famous quote that everybody
knows about

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,590
correlational research is that correlation
does not imply causation.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,190
Indeed, we can't make strong causal
arguments like

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,780
we can from experimental research with
correlational research.

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,257
That's not to say that core, correlational
research doesn't have its

13
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:54,677
place or isn't powerful, in fact it's very
powerful and, and we've

14
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,114
learned a lot.

15
00:00:56,114 --> 00:01:00,240
from correlational research particularly
in the social sciences.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,460
And those are the examples I'm going to
show you in this lecture.

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,880
So this lecture is broken down into three
segments.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,336
The first segment I'll talk about
personality research and how

19
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:15,760
much we've learned in terms Of
correlational research in personality.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,792
The second segment is on intelligence
research, and again we've learned

21
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,264
a lot about the structure of

22
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:24,890
human intelligence, based on correlational
research.

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,618
And, then I'll talk about correlational
research

24
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:30,620
that sort of looks like experimental
research.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,820
And that's research that involves what I
call quasi-independent variables.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,360
And I'll use a medical.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,610
An example of medical research there, I'll
talk about sports related concussion.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,050
So, but in this first segment let's talk
about personality research.

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,420
In personality research, in psychology
there's this famous quote

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,545
from Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker
who said, as any parent

31
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:57,470
of more than one child knows, children are
not

32
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,060
indistingui-, indistinguishable lumps of
raw material waiting to be shaped.

33
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,060
They are little people, born with little
personalities.

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,380
In other words he's arguing there's,
there's some thing that might be innate or

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,325
at least a very fine, a very hard grained
trait such

36
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:21,306
as personality trait.
So here's an example of a

37
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:26,178
baby who is clearly very extroverted very
fun

38
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:31,398
seeking clearly not shy, introverted
probably

39
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:36,450
not very neurotic, okay?
And these things can be measured from very

40
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,767
early on and how do we measure them, and
how do we test that idea of

41
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:44,385
Pinker's that there are different
personalities in different

42
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:48,230
kids and that they're relatively stable
over time.

43
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,940
Well, it's hard to do experimental
research on this.

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,660
We can do experimental research to try and
prime

45
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,722
people to be more introverted or to be
more extroverted.

46
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,839
but to look at people sort of stable

47
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:08,082
trait-like qualities over time, it's
easier just to do correlational research.

48
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:12,360
so first let me be clear about what I mean
about a personality traits.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,117
Traits are considered to be relatively
stable, distinguishable qualities of

50
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:20,160
a person and stable over the course of a
life time.

51
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,022
In personality psychology the dominant
theory in

52
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:32,660
personality research is known as the Big
Five personality model.

53
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,006
So there's five different personality
traits that seem to

54
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:43,200
emerge as you look for correlations across
people.

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
So there's openness,

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,760
conscientiousness,extroversion,
agreeableness and neuroticism.

57
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,490
And a lot of people use this acronym,
OCEAN, to remember that.

58
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:01,030
So the big five theory and, or known as
the OCEAN theory of personality.

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,830
Now, how do we study this?

60
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,880
One of the most popular ways to study this
is just to administer surveys.

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,020
So, ask people questions.

62
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,760
Like, I am the life of the party.
Is that true for you?

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,960
Or is that not true for you?
Give you a scale from one to seven.

64
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,920
How much do you agree or disagree with
that statement.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,300
So if you think back to that picture of
the

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,870
little kid, that little kid grown up now
would probably

67
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,138
be, yep I strongly agree.
I am typically the life of the party.

68
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,660
or the second question.

69
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,670
I don't mind being the center of
attention.

70
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,114
Looks like that kid didn't mind being the
center of attention, right?

71
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,236
and as a grown up, that kid

72
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:43,690
probably doesn't mind being the center of
attention.

73
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,460
This is what the personalities surveys
online typically look

74
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,980
like, so they're a series of questions
like that,

75
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,920
so this first one is, I am the life of the
party, and it, you're just asked to.

76
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,224
Strongly disagree or strongly agree, or
maybe you're somewhere

77
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:07,230
in between, maybe you're a little
ambivalent on that question.

78
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,640
And there are lots of different kinds of
questions.

79
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,509
I feel little concern for

80
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,158
others, that would be low on
conscientiousness

81
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:15,781
[LAUGH],

82
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:21,388
I'm always prepared, I tend to manipulate
others to get my way.

83
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,835
I don't like some of these people.

84
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:23,780
[LAUGH]

85
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,600
I get stressed out easily and so on.
Okay?

86
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,720
what we can do is take people's responses
to those

87
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,160
questions and then we can look for
correlations across.

88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,600
Those questions.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,408
So, if I take the question, I am the life
of

90
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:47,860
the party and I don't mind being the
center of attention.

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,380
Those two questions,

92
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,180
if I asked hundreds of people, people's

93
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,540
responses to those two questions should be
correlated.

94
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,670
Such that if I score high on one of them,
say.

95
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,900
This is, I am the life of the party.

96
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,290
And say I score high on that one.
then chances are you're going to

97
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,800
score high on this question that says, I
don't mind being the center of attention.

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,400
So, that would be.

99
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,010
This, people represented by that dot are
high on each question.

100
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:30,504
They score a five, I strongly agree that I
don't, that I I am the life of the

101
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:36,640
party, and I strongly agree that I don't
mind being the center of attention.

102
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,297
So that's why these dots here Along th,
this line

103
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:47,732
are larger than the dots that are off of
the line like,

104
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:53,881
this dot are harder to see, even this dot
because so

105
00:06:53,881 --> 00:07:00,790
few people are low on one score and high
on the other.

106
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,060
So it's, it'd be very rare for example for
someone to score right here,

107
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,460
which is yes I'm very high on I'm the life
of the

108
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,730
party but no I don't like to be the center
of attention.

109
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,420
That doesn't make much sense.

110
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,470
So that's why those dots are much smaller.

111
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,230
Very few people land there.
If we do these types of surveys.

112
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,430
It's more common that they land along

113
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,180
this line which indicates a strong
positive correlation.

114
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,370
We'll get into correlations in more detail
next week.

115
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,430
And the, there's an entire lecture on
correlations.

116
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,886
But, the point of this slide is just to
show that there's

117
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:46,730
a strong positive correlation among those
types of questions in personality surveys.

118
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,321
And years and years of research, not just
on surveys, but using the

119
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:53,219
surveys correlated with observations of
behavior and

120
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,558
people's reports about others' behavior,
their friends,

121
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,746
their family members.

122
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,669
support this idea that there are stable

123
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,540
personality traits consistent with the big
five model.

124
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,350
Here is just the same slide with what's
known as the regression line thrown in.

125
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,910
Again, we'll get to the details of

126
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,370
that when we cover correlation regression
next week.

127
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,537
So, this theory of the five components of
personality is supported by

128
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:33,780
years and years of correlational research.
Primarily correlational research.

129
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,990
Not much experimental research has gone

130
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,170
into this, but lots of correlational
research.

131
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,710
So surveys like the on I just
demonstrated.

132
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,600
As I mentioned, interviews with friends
and family.

133
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,614
And just obersvations of people's
behavior.

134
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:52,542
these things tend to correlate, so people
who say I am the

135
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:56,210
life of the party, I don't mind being the
center of attention.

136
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,679
Then if you do an observational study, And

137
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,480
you just see how they behave in certain
environments.

138
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,670
They tend to be the more extroverted
types.

139
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,150
These things tend to be positively
correlated.

140
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,580
And we can observe that through
correlational research.

141
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,030
so that's the point of correlational
research.

142
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,382
And if you're interested in personality
research, you know, this course

143
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:21,076
is not going to be about psychology or
personality per se, but If

144
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:24,521
you're interested in learning more about
that, you can just Google the

145
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:27,600
Five Factor Model of Personality if you
want to learn more about that.
