1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,080
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,704
We're in Lecture two, Segment three, and
I'm

3
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:10,904
still talking abut correlational research,
but this type

4
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:13,720
of correlational research is a little bit
different

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,460
from the first two segments on personality
and intelligence.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,320
In this segment, I want to talk about an
example on the effects of

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,700
sports-related concussion on cognition and
on on the brain.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,190
So this is an example of medical research.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,509
So, the effects of concussion or
sports-related

10
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:38,064
concussion in particular has become a hot

11
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:40,838
topic of research, particularly here in
the

12
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:44,370
U.S. and particularly related to American
football.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,238
There's been lots of studies recently,
especially in the last decade, showing

14
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:57,388
that there are really, sort of, terrible
effects neurally and cognitively,

15
00:00:57,388 --> 00:01:00,586
for athletes who suffer sports-related

16
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:05,040
concussions, particularly in American
football.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,000
So how do we study that?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,115
Well, these, these studies look like

19
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:17,188
experiments.
So if you think back to the first lecture

20
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,580
on experimental research, this setup will
look like that setup.

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,980
So, there's what looks like an

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,580
independent variable, but I'm

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,580
going to call it a quasi-independent

24
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,967
variable.
So, this treatment, if you will,

25
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:47,971
is whether an athlete suffers a concussion
or doesn't suffer

26
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:48,988
a concussion.

27
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:49,828
So we can compare athletes to athletes who

28
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:50,740
are very similar to them, play the same
exact

29
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,484
sport, are the same age, sort of the

30
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,030
same, level of expertise, but don't suffer
a concussion.

31
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,940
So they're the control group.

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,710
And then we can measure them on several
dependent variables.

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,236
So we can look neurally at measures of the
brain

34
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:06,790
structure and function, and we can look at
cognitive measures.

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,320
So measures of short-term memory and
attention are most common.

36
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,150
but what's

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,910
tricky here is this is not a true
independent variable,

38
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,210
in that I don't have random assignment to
conditions.

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,490
That is, I can't, as a

40
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,826
researcher, take a group of

41
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:39,426
athletes and randomly assign

42
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:45,234
them to be concussed or not

43
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:50,649
concussed.
All right, that would

44
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:56,079
be sort of fun and / or evil, but I can't
do that.

45
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,894
I just have to wait for them to happen as
a

46
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,984
researcher and, unfortunately they happen

47
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:02,556
pretty frequently, especially here at
Princeton.

48
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:03,712
Our, our football team, they happen pretty
quickly, when our football

49
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:04,528
players arrive here in the fall is when
they play football

50
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,710
in the U.S..
It's not random assignment to conditions.

51
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,650
So that's not a true independent variable.

52
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,200
That's really important when you think
about making those

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,310
causal claims about what's causing these
changes down here.

54
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,312
Is it really the concussion or is it
something, something else about

55
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:24,610
these athletes that led them to be
concussed in the first place.

56
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,350
We'll get back to that at the end of the
segment.

57
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,270
So, here's an example of one of the

58
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,862
assessments, is, so, once an athlete
suffers a concussion

59
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:39,060
we might ask them something like this I'm

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,604
going to, to assess their concentration,
or their attention.

61
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm going to read to you a string of
numbers and when

62
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,040
I'm done, you repeat them back to me in
reverse order.

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,870
This is known as backwards digit span in
cognitive psychology.

64
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,210
So, for example, if i say seven, one,
nine, you have to say nine, one, seven.

65
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,820
That's not a great example for New
Yorkers.

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,648
That's the area code in New York.

67
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:05,198
[LAUGH]

68
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,000
917.
That would be too easy.

69
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,825
So if you get that correct, then you go to
a longer string length,

70
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:18,350
and you can see down here the different
examples that these athletes are given.

71
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,548
And when we give this to athletes at
baseline,

72
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,600
so when athletes come to Princeton, we
actually do this.

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,931
We give them baseline assessments when
they

74
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:30,514
first get to Princeton before they start
playing

75
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:33,610
a sport.
We give them this sort of test.

76
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,240
They all do really well.

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,270
They basically max out on it.
For instance, students can do up to

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,220
like five, six numbers and they can do it
backwards very easily.

79
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,249
But after a concussion, after a really bad
hit, if they're

80
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:55,621
an American football player, sometimes
they're really bad, and so we can

81
00:04:55,621 --> 00:05:00,030
look at their change, this pre-post test
sort of design.

82
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,300
We can look at their change in performance
on a test like this before, that

83
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,090
is baseline before a concussion, and then
post, after, a concussion.

84
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,220
And we can do that for a control group.

85
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,131
We can give them this test once at the
beginning of

86
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:20,370
the season and then say randomly at some
point during the season.

87
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:20,860
But they

88
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,870
haven't suffered a concussion so we can
use them as

89
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,870
a comparison group for the group that did
suffer a concussion.

90
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,830
So what we typically see in these types

91
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,190
of studies is that the concussed athletes
perform

92
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,790
much worse on these measures of short-term
memory,

93
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,310
attention, also balance is a good measure,
so

94
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,350
once an, right after an athlete suffers a
hit If you give them a balance test

95
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,440
where they just have to stand on one leg
they can't do it for very long.

96
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,435
Like right now I'm doing it fine I wasn't

97
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:56,575
concussed this morning

98
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:57,060
[LAUGH].

99
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,570
So but if I was concussed what would look,
I would just like do

100
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,326
that very quickly and that's a very good
assessment actually of

101
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:11,602
concussion.
so it looks like we have pretty

102
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:16,894
nice causal claims that the hit caused
performance on this

103
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:22,085
balance test or this attention test.
the backward

104
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,556
digit span.

105
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:26,436
but there are potential confounds, right,
because

106
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,790
we don't have a true independent variable.

107
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,910
There could be other variables that are
leading to this result.

108
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,720
So one problem, and this is a problem
we've dealt with in the research here at

109
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,976
Princeton, is lots of these athletes have
suffered

110
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:46,760
concussions before, so is it really this
one hit?

111
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
that caused

112
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,880
them to become suddenly really off

113
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,890
balance or suddenly interrupt their
short-term memory?

114
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,210
.

115
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,730
Or is it the cumulative affect of several
hits and this one

116
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,970
being the one that really, finally caused
this damage?

117
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,320
So, is it this one hit or this history of
concussions.

118
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,560
We don't know because we don't have true

119
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,490
random assignment to conditions.

120
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:19,576
we can look at their history of prior
concussions and try and

121
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:24,220
tease that apart, but it's not as strong
as a true experiment.

122
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,120
Alright that's more like correlational
research.

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,781
That's why it's here in this lecture on
correlational research, is

124
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:36,450
this kind of thing looks like a true
experiment, but it's not.

125
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,590
Okay, so be,

126
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:43,100
be very careful, especially as consumers
of research and consumers

127
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,800
of statistics, be very careful to be able
to spot sort of correlational

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,850
research that's dressed up as experimental
research.

129
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,622
So, this is a great example of that, is it
looks like

130
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:59,016
experimental research, because you have
people

131
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:02,020
who are concussed, and people who weren't.

132
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,669
It looks like

133
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:04,970
a nice experimental group and control
group,

134
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,500
but it's, they weren't randomly assigned
to conditions.

135
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,512
So deep down it's just correlational
research, it's really no different from

136
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:14,813
the intelligence research that I
mentioned,

137
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:18,230
and the personality research that I
mentioned.

138
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:24,720
Okay, so there, there's, this is open up
to lots of different types of confounds.

139
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,626
In particular there might be certain
personality

140
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:32,625
types that are more likely to put
themselves in

141
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:37,650
in a position where they're susceptible to
this concussion.

142
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,110
So maybe certain personality types that
are more aggressive, for example,

143
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,654
in American football are more likely to
become concussed than others and maybe

144
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:54,030
aggressive people have certain types of
brain structure or function or

145
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,560
certain types of work perform cognitive
measures differently than others.

146
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,056
We don't know, again because this isn't
as, sort of

147
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:07,770
tight as the true experimental research
like the polio vaccine trials.

148
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,696
So again, the main point of this

149
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:18,070
segment is to point out quasi-independent
variables.

150
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,400
And again, since the independent variable
doesn't

151
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,840
involve random representative sampling,
arguments about causality

152
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,760
aren't as strong, and that's the main
thing to take away from this segment.

153
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,303
To summarize the entire lecture,

154
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:37,452
just recognize the distinction between
correlational

155
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,400
research and experimental research as we
go forward

156
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,910
and start to get more into the statistics.

157
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,388
This first week has been mostly about
methods but as

158
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:50,162
I said, as consumers of statistics or now
that you're about

159
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:54,232
to become people who are skilled in doing
statistics, it's

160
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:58,370
important to know what type of research
are you engaging in.

161
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,110
Are you engaging in experimental research
or correlational research?

162
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,120
And again, I'll refer to correlational
research

163
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,020
as studies, and experimental research as
simply experiments.

164
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,004
The main important concepts to take away,
are that theories of personality and

165
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:24,120
intelligence, those have been supported by
investigating patterns of correlations.

166
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,180
Obtained from observation, observational,
correlational studies.

167
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,530
and some things we just simply can't
manipulate ethically.

168
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:33,750
Right?

169
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,898
All right, so we can't just take people
into, take people to a football

170
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:41,680
field and randomly assign them to be
concussed or not concussed.

171
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:49,660
there are lots of things like gender,
male,

172
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,280
female religious affiliation.

173
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,252
I can't randomly assign those things to
people.

174
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,151
The people come to my laboratory or to

175
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,833
a laboratory setting with just those
traits or characteristics.

176
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,729
We can't randomly assign them, so those
are quasi-independent variables.

177
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,475
And they fall under the category of
correlational research.

178
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:13,100
So those are the main concepts

179
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,175
to take away from this segment,

180
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:24,152
and from this first week.
