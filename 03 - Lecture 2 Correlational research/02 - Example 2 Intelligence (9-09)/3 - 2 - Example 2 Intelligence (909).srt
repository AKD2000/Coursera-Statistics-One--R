1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,940
Hi, welcome back.
We're in Lecture 2, Segment 2.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,775
The topic of this lecture is correlational
research, and the topic of

3
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:15,780
this segment is intelligence research,
which is my own area of expertise.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,335
And the point of this segment is, again,

5
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:21,633
to talk about how correlational research,
is used.

6
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,738
To understand the structure of human
intelligence,

7
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:28,000
and to develop theories, about human
intelligence.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,750
So what is intelligence?
Intelligence, is famously difficult to

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,810
define, so I took a pretty popular
definition, from the Wall Street Journal.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,570
back in 1994, this was an agreed upon
definition,

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,010
by top researchers in the field at the
time.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,034
And they defined intelligence, as a very
general

13
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:56,210
mental capability that, among other
things, involves the ability

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,425
to reason, plan, solve problems, think
abstractly, comprehend complex ideas.

15
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:04,904
Learn quickly, and learn from experience,
is not merely

16
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:09,500
book learning, a narrow academic skill, or
test taking smarts.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,453
Rather, it reflects a broader, and

18
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:15,360
deeper capability, for comprehending our
surroundings.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
It's catching on, it's making sense of
things, or figuring out what to do.

20
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,105
Now, what type of research supports that
idea, or supports even

21
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:30,750
the idea, that there is such a thing, as a
general intelligence?

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,515
Well over 100 years of research, that

23
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:39,100
mainly employs, correlational research
methods, supports that idea.

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,700
So basically, the idea that, if you score
well in 1 type of

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,308
subject in school, you're going to score
well on another type of subject, or

26
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,900
if you score well on 1 kind of mental
test,

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,960
you tend to score well, on another type of
mental test.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,560
This has been observed, over and over

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,189
again, for over 100 years, in intelligence
research.

30
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,499
And so, as this slide indicates, we know
this

31
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:08,302
from examining lots, and lots of patterns
of correlations.

32
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:12,532
And, I'll refer to these types of
investigations

33
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:17,120
as studies, just like the personality
research.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,760
is, they're mainly studies.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,796
They're not experiments, and there's, it's
an

36
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:24,625
important distinction is these are just
studies

37
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,454
of behavior, and that nothing is
manipulated,

38
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:31,894
whereas in experimental research there's a
manipulation.

39
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:35,890
the polio vaccine trials There is a
manipulation.

40
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,464
A child received a vaccine, or

41
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,790
a placebo.

42
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,290
In the working memory training
experiments, there was a manipulation.

43
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,010
They either did the training, or they
didn't do the training.

44
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,140
These are just studies, of behavior.

45
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,090
We go out.

46
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,600
We measure lots of things, and look for
patterns of correlation.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,220
There's no manipulations in these, in
these studies.

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,620
So important distinction, between study,
and experiment.

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,926
So here's an example, again, of a positive

50
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:10,790
correlation, and this is what we typically
see,

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:17,712
if we administer some sort of mental test,
or IQ tests to lots, and lots of people.

52
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:23,241
what tends to happen is, if we have 1 IQ
test here, on the x axis

53
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:28,479
people who do well on this test, they tend
to do well, on another

54
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,800
IQ test.
So, you see, all, each dot in this.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,440
This is called, the scatter plot.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,240
We'll get into this more, on the lecture
on correlation,

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,696
and in the lab, in the second lab, on
correlation regression.

58
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:48,850
people who do well, on 1 test tend to do
well, on another kind of test.

59
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,104
And this has been observed, for over 100,
100 years and lots, and lots, and

60
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:56,490
lots of studies, of Intelligence.

61
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,304
So that lead, to the first sort of idea,

62
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:08,270
or theory of intelligence, proposed by
Charles Spearman in 1904.

63
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,614
That there is some sort, of general
intelligence,

64
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:15,880
that must account for this positive
correlation across.

65
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,295
All sorts of test, or all cites, all sorts
of types of material

66
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:26,140
in school, so if we looked at kids' grades
in History,

67
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,460
in a Language class, in a Math class, in a
Science class, they all

68
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,459
tend to show that positive correlation.
So there must

69
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,508
be some factor, or some trait, among
individuals, or

70
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:46,854
among kids in school that causes this
variance, or causes these

71
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:52,650
correlations across all these different
kinds of tests.

72
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,820
And Spearman referred that, referred to
that as g, or general intelligence.

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,090
1, of Spearman's early critics, Therstone,
observed

74
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,100
that well some correlations, are stronger
than others.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,300
Yes, all the correlations across the, the
children's school grades

76
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,980
are positive, but some of them, are
stronger than others.

77
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,086
So for example,

78
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:22,340
if I look at a correlation between Math,
and Science.

79
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:28,170
That correlation tends to be higher, than
say Math, and History.

80
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,602
Even though this is a positive
correlation,

81
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:32,530
the slope of this line's going up.

82
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,613
this line is going up.
It's a positive correlation.

83
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:40,580
The correlation between math, and science
scores

84
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,478
tends to be higher, than the correlation
between

85
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,750
math, and history scores.

86
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,630
So, Thurstone argued, that there are
different types, of intelligence.

87
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,632
So there's something like verbal ability,

88
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:57,957
and perhaps spatial, or mathematical
ability.

89
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:03,384
And those are separable, and so verbal
ability, is more important for history

90
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:08,811
class, and language class, and spatial
ability, or quantitative ability,

91
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:13,570
is more important in math class, and
science class.

92
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,350
And there's some support for that, theory
of intelligence.

93
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,360
The only problem with that approach, is
that there

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,860
still tends, to be a positive correlation
between these guys.

95
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,700
So even among verbal, and spacial ability,
there's still some positive correlation.

96
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,616
As you saw, in the scatter plot with math,

97
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:36,490
and history scores.
There's still positive.

98
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,524
So what that led people, to propose is

99
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:44,900
what's known, as a hierarchical model of
intelligence.

100
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,860
And this is, remains the most dominant
model,

101
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,640
of the structure of human intelligence, to
this day.

102
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,941
Is the idea that, there's still this
general

103
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:57,554
intelligence, or g factor, if you've heard
of that.

104
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:59,400
in, in the media there's

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,666
a general intelligence, and then there's
several of

106
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,658
these sort, of group factors as they're
known.

107
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:12,270
that predict performance, in lots of
different, either academic

108
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:19,290
classrooms, or in different kinds of
mental tests, different types of IQ tests.

109
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,126
So this is sort of, the dominant

110
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:24,458
prevailing theory of intelligence, and
it's supported

111
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,450
by years, and years, and years, and
studies, and

112
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,230
studies, and studies, that have examined
patterns on correlations.

113
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,459
So this hierarchical model, of
intelligence is supported, just like the

114
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:43,270
big 5 factor model of personality is
supported by correlational research.

115
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:48,110
and that's summarized here, in this slide.

116
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,588
There's a general ability, and then
there's several

117
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:55,140
more specific abilities, and you need both
of those

118
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,766
to fully account, for all the patterns of
correlations,

119
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:02,650
that we observe, in these types of
correlational studies.

120
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,550
And again it, this is, I just

121
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,250
want to use this an example, of
correlational research.

122
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,834
I don't want to get into a big debate
about

123
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:14,660
intelligence but if you do want to know
more about.

124
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,598
Intelligence research, feel free to look
at my own research, I do research on this.

125
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,747
or if you want to know more about that
hierarchical model I

126
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:29,210
just showed you, just Google, the Cattell
Horn Carroll theory of intelligence.

127
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,780
That's sort of the prominent theory, of
intelligence right now.

128
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,080
Again, why is it the prominent theory of
intelligence, because it's

129
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,240
supported by.

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,242
Years of correlational research, looking
at patterns of correlations

131
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:47,420
among lots of different test scores, no
experimental research per say.

132
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,690
We're not manipulating anything in those
studies.

133
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,730
We're just looking at the patterns of
correlations, across test scores, or task

134
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,870
scores.
And that's the end, of that segment.
