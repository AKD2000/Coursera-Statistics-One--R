[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:03,144 --> 00:00:05,940
Hi!
Welcome, to Statistics One.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,010
This is the first lecture, and the topic
for this lecture is Experimental Research.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,536
As I mentioned in the introduction video,
it's

5
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:18,632
important to know as either a consumer of,

6
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:22,502
of statistics, or as someone engaged in
statistical

7
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:26,300
analyses, what type of research are you
doing?

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,354
What kinds of questions are you

9
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:33,770
asking, and, and what kinds of questions
might you ask of your data?

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,162
So, in this first week, we'll talk about
first experimental research

11
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:42,480
here in lecture one, and then
correlational research in lecture 2.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,206
Because they have a very different feel
and they,

13
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:50,650
they typically work with very different
kinds of data.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,380
so let's hear this first lecture, talk
about

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,650
experimental research.
This first lecture is broken

16
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,224
up into 3 segments, and that'll be common
as we go through the course.

17
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:09,556
each lecture will be typically broken,
into either 2 or 3 segments

18
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:15,754
hopefully around 10 minutes each, but
that'll fluctuate a bit.

19
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:18,330
so in this first lecture we have 3
segments.

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,914
The first one, I'll give you just an
example

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,588
of experimental research in action the
polio vaccine trials.

22
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:28,201
another in the second segment, I'll give
you

23
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:32,850
another example more recent research on
working memory training.

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,726
>> And then, in the third segment,

25
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:38,502
we'll talk more, about this concept of
randomness.

26
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:43,466
you'll see an important aspect to
experimental research, is random selection

27
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:47,880
from a population, and random assignment
to conditions.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,620
So let's go into this first segment.

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:00,822
In the first half of the twentieth
century, there were approximately 20,000

30
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:06,178
cases of polio, per year, in the USA.
In 1952, was a particularly bad year.

31
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:10,330
There were 58,000 cases, just in that one
year alone.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,245
And polio was a very debilitating disease.
It was very frightening

33
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:18,805
>> it ha, it, it, was, happened among
children

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:24,505
of all, backgrounds, and, some years, as I
noted here, in

35
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:30,080
1952, were particularly bad and, and, and,
and worrying.

36
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:39,260
so in 1952, the first effective polio
vaccine, was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk.

37
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,680
And how do we know, in retrospect you
know, over

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,330
60 years later, how do we know that it was
effective?

39
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,770
Well, through experimental research.

40
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,730
More specifically through, randomized
controlled experiments.

41
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,628
And this set of studies, is now known as
the Salk vaccine trials.

42
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:02,964
one of the greatest examples of
experimental research, put to use to

43
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:08,392
solve a very critical problem facing
modern society, and it's a

44
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:13,730
really great success story of ex, of
experimental research.

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,740
So how did it work?

46
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,900
Well, to do experimental research.

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,230
Again, go back to the introductory
lecture.

48
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,656
We need

49
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:26,860
a sample, and we need a population.
So what was the population?

50
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,760
At first, the population was all children
in the USA.

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,620
And it, it, actually, the population
really is all children worldwide.

52
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,080
But these initial studies, were funded by
the U.S. government.

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,750
The Salk vaccine trials.

54
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,802
I'll define the population, as all
children in the U.S. that's what Salk was

55
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:53,854
hoping he could generalize his vaccine
results to, is all children in the U.S.

56
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:59,570
The sample, of course he couldn't get his
hands on all children in the US.

57
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,380
So the sample initially, was just 4000
children from the state of Virginia.

58
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,280
That turned out to be pretty promising
results

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,480
from that first sample, so the US
government

60
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,680
funded the research further, and they
expanded the sample ultimately to

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,730
include 1.8 million children from 44 of
the fifty United States.

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,502
So in this experiment, the independent
variable, or what some

63
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:38,760
people may call the treatment.
>> Is what the child actually received.

64
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,544
So some children received the actual live
vaccine,

65
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:47,520
the polio vaccine, and other children
received a placebo.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,006
So they got a vaccine, but there was no,
live

67
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:51,919
[INAUDIBLE],

68
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,360
live polio vaccine, it was just, placebo.

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,710
The dependent variable is what you measure
after the treatment.

70
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,030
So the dependent variable was, you can
think of this in one of two ways.

71
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,500
One if you look at the level of the
individual child.

72
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,600
You could think of it as a polio
diagnosis.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,382
So each individual child, is either going
to have a polio diagnosis,

74
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:22,520
so we could score that as a one or not be
diagnosed with polio.

75
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,985
You would score that as a 0.

76
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,555
Or, if we look at the level of a

77
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:33,470
community of children, look at towns or
villages or states.

78
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,950
Then we could look at the rate of polio,
among a certain number of, of children.

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,000
So two different ways, to score this
dependent variable.

80
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,302
One of the cool things about using the
Salk vaccine trial, as an

81
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:57,260
example to start this course, is it was a
double blind experiment.

82
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,700
Those are actually.

83
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,652
>> Pretty rare in experiment, in
experimental psychology, or in, in,

84
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:10,940
experimental trials, in general, because
it's difficult to do.

85
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,200
What

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,995
I mean by double-blind, is that the
experimenter

87
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:17,380
didn't know if the treatment that they
were giving

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,020
>> To the child was the placebo or was
the vaccine.

89
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,595
So the person administering the actual
vaccine, didn't know if

90
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:28,570
the child was getting the vaccine, or
getting the placebo.

91
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,591
So no one on site at the time knew which
one the child was getting, and

92
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,605
the child and the parents, they didn't
know

93
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:36,010
if they were getting the vaccine, or the
placebo.

94
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,361
The final results, from several trials can

95
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,990
be summarized here.
This is the rate per 100,000.

96
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,359
So, children who were given the vaccine,
28 out of 100,000

97
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:56,590
went on to develop polio, versus the
control, who got a placebo.

98
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:04,040
71 out of 100,000 developed polio.
So, you can see, almost, 3 times

99
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,980
more children, who did not receive the
vaccine went on to develop polio.

100
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,432
So, we can see, just looking at these
numbers, that this was a

101
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:21,190
success story and sure enough, the US
continued to use the Salk vaccine.

102
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:28,950
And by 1994, polio had been completely
eradicated, from all of the Americas.

103
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:34,310
So this is a great success story, of how
we can see experimental research.

104
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,500
>> Put to use to solve a problem, and
eradicate what I call bad stuff.

105
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:46,290
so to summarize this segment, the major
benefit of experiemental

106
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,410
research, is that they allow for strong
claims about causality.

107
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,970
So why does stuff happen?

108
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,530
So why was the polio vaccine happening?

109
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,280
There was this disease that was spreading
through communities.

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,160
Salk thought he had a vaccine that could
prevent it.

111
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,345
And sure enough, if he gave the
vaccination to enough

112
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:17,170
children, they were able to prevent the
bad stuff from happening.

113
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,034
So again,

114
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:24,170
experiments allow us to make causal
claims, about why stuff happens.

115
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,737
So that allows us to predict stuff, which
mean we

116
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:32,720
can pre, prevent bad stuff, and we can
promote good stuff.

117
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:32,721
[LAUGH].

118
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,890
So we use it in very basic terms, right?

119
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,210
so this is a good example where societies
are.

120
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,800
We have a lot of bad stuff happening.

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,752
We have this disease, we have to
eradicate, and

122
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:46,776
if we can do an experiment to predict why
it's

123
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,944
happening, and how we can stop it, then
indeed, we

124
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:53,500
can stop it, and that's what the Salk
vaccine trials.

125
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,060
>> were able to do.

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,179
These strong causal

127
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:03,261
claims require a lot of things, so, they
require what I call true independent

128
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:07,822
variables.
That is, a group of, of subjects, or in

129
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:13,010
this case, a group of children Come to a
facility, and

130
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,960
they're randomly assigned to receive one,
level of

131
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,515
variable or another.
So they were randomly assigned to receive

132
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:28,250
the vaccine or the placebo.
That's a true independent variable.

133
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,610
I'll talk in the next lecture about, some
quasi independent variables,

134
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,034
that aren't as strong as this.
it requires a random,

135
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:44,218
and representative sample so initially the
Salk vaccine

136
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:49,930
trials only were done on children from
Virginia.

137
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,480
And maybe it only worked in that subset of
children.

138
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,040
Maybe it wouldn't generalize to the entire
United States.

139
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,379
They had to see, so they had to broaden
their sample, get a more

140
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:04,214
random representative sample, of the
entire United

141
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:06,220
States, to see if it really worked.

142
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,770
Fortunately, it did.
and finally.

143
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,288
Experimental research in these strong
causal claims depend on the,

144
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:20,530
require that we don't have any confounds
in the experiment.

145
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,350
And that's almost impossible, to rule out
entirely.

146
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,760
There might always be confounds.

147
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,118
So there could have been confounds, in
terms of the age

148
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:35,500
of children, or again the geographical
location, or their socioeconomic status.

149
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,460
There could have been lots of confounds,
in this example.

150
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,555
Fortunately they

151
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:46,730
ruled out most of those in the research as
they were doing the, the vaccine trials.

152
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,650
But its something to keep in mind, as we
look at experimental research.

153
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,530
These strong causal claims, require that
there are no confounds lurking behind,

154
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:06,176
lurking in the shadows.
And we'll address that issue, a little

155
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:11,846
more directly in the next segment as

156
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:17,761
we look at Working memory training.
