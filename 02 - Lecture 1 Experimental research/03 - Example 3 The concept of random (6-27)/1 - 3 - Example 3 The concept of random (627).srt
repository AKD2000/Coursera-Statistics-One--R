00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,780
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,690
We're in segment three of lecture one on
experimental research.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,544
This last, last segment is very short and
it's based on

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,562
the feedback we got last year in the
discussion forums, is

5
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:22,520
not everybody Fully understood what I
meant when I said random selection

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,688
from a population and random assignment to
conditions in an experiment.

7
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:28,832
So

8
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:32,470
I want to talk a little bit more about
this concept of random.

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,146
So As mentioned in the first two segments
of lecture one experimental

10
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:48,660
research critically depends upon random
selection and random assignment.

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,270
So what do we mean by those?

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,095
So random selection means that individuals
included

13
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,420
in a sample should be randomly selected.

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,206
From the population.
So, in the polio

15
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:06,246
vaccines trials, what that means is, we
should be randomly selecting

16
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:11,034
children from the entire United States if
all children in the United

17
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:15,970
States is the population that we want to
make our inferences about.

18
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:22,054
in the working memory training example, if
we're, if we want to

19
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:26,590
make inferences about all young healthy
adults, then we should

20
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,630
get a random sample from all young healthy
adults.

21
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,110
Of course, that didn't happen in the one
experiment I showed you.

22
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:38,457
that's the idea is we have a population,
and

23
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:41,967
if we want to make an inference about that
population,

24
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,321
if we want to generalize to that
population, then we

25
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:48,660
need to get a random sample from that
population.

26
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,107
That's random selection Once we get that
random

27
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:58,080
selection, then we want to do random
assignment to conditions.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,240
The way I want to illustrate this is
through this color wheel.

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,630
Okay, so imagine we have this color wheel,
and I can spin this color wheel.

30
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:14,190
So, make my pen work.
We can spin it like on a game show.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,730
I can spin it and it can,

32
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,120
it can randomly come up on any color.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,090
So I, I can't predict which color it's
going to come up.

34
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,510
If it's truly random, and we spin this
wheel over and over and over again.

35
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,660
And we just.

36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,400
Count out how many times I get yellow, how
many times I get green,

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,940
how many times I get blue, then we should
have what's called a uniform distribution.

38
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,956
In other words it should look

39
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:42,590
like this.

40
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,100
This would be a random distribution of
spins.

41
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,340
So what's plotted here is on the x-axis.

42
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,890
We have the different colors that were in
the color wheel.

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,110
And, on the y-axis, is frequency.
And this is a

44
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,990
histogram, which you're going to cover in
the first lab later this week.

45
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,140
And what happens

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,582
is, you don't get them to be perfectly
equal, but what you see is They're

47
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:16,730
all about the same height.
So on average you would get

48
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,765
it would fall on the yellow pie, piece of
the pie just as often as

49
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:26,830
it would fall on the red piece of the pie
if it were truly random.

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,049
What would a non random sample look like?

51
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,090
Well, it might look something like this.

52
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,122
Say the wheel was biased so that it was
sort of heavier on the yellow and

53
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:47,830
green portion of it, so that it would fall
there more often than not.

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,360
Then, we might get lots and lots of cases
where it falls.

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,607
On the green slice of the pie, or on the
yellow slice of the pie,

56
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:03,810
and very, very rarely might it fall on the
red or the purple slices.

57
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,883
Now if you were you know, running sort of,
an illegal

58
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:09,328
[LAUGH]

59
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:14,000
gambling shop, this is how you would set
it up, right?

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,260
So you would put the sort of high value
prizes on red and purple.

61
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,867
And put the low value prices on green and

62
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:26,185
yellow and then you would always win as
the house,

63
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:30,056
and that's actually how a lot of gambling
houses work

64
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:34,480
is they're, they're not random they're
sort of non-random to

65
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,280
favor the house the owners of the gambling
facility.

66
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,130
so don't gamble.

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,990
That's is the worst thing a statistician
can do.

68
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,430
so this is what a non random distribution
would look like.

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,570
So, that was random selection from the
population.

70
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,950
Experiments also depend on random
assignment to conditions.

71
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,614
So we want there to be a 50, 50 chance,

72
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:04,610
for example that a child gets, either the
vaccine or the placebo.

73
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,852
Or, for example, that a subject coming in
to

74
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:08,858
do memory training, we want there to be a

75
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,395
50, 50 chance that they get assigned to
either

76
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,240
the true memory training condition or a
control condition.

77
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,910
So.

78
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,320
There's random assignment to conditions.

79
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,650
And if we successfully assign subjects to
conditions

80
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,690
then we should get something that looks
like this.

81
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,835
And with respect to this color wheel
example

82
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,215
so group one and group two not only

83
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:34,870
should they have this sort of uniform
distribution

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,940
of colors but they should also look
similar.

85
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,862
So group one should have a similar
distribution to group two.

86
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:45,487
So this is an example of random assignment

87
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:49,150
to, two groups or two conditions in an
experiment.

88
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:50,842
So to

89
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:56,088
recap, experimental research requires and
critically depends on this

90
00:05:56,088 --> 00:06:01,395
idea of randomness.
One, random selection from the population

91
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:06,430
so that our sample is, is randomly
selected, and two, random

92
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,244
assignment to conditions so that we have
similar types of samples.

93
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:15,182
Across the conditions in the experiment.

94
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:17,091
