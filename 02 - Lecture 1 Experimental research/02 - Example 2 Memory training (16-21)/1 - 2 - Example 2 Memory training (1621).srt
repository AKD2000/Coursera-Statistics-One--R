1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,950
Hi, welcome back.
We're in Lecture 1, Segment 2.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,270
We're talking about experimental research.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,390
In the first segment, we talked about the
polio

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,410
vaccine trials, a clear success story of
experimental research.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,190
In this segment, we'll talk about more

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,400
recent research on memory training, and
the idea

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,270
that you can use memory training
techniques or

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,630
online brain games to enhance your memory
and

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,110
perhaps enhance your intelligence.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,930
The jury is still out as to whether this
type

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,080
of experimental research is as successful
as the polio vaccine trials.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,530
So I'll describe one experiment to you to
give you a flavor for how this works, and

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,925
we'll talk about why there's still some
controversy around this research.

14
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:54,640
So the idea behind Memory Training, and

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,680
you may have seen some of these things
online are referred to as brain games

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,470
that you can train your memory, train your
attention to enhance

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,510
your intelligence.
is, you, you

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,800
engage in days and days and days perhaps
weeks up to a month of

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,250
memory training and you do a, a test
before,

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,466
a test after training, that's called a
pre-post test

21
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:28,460
design to see if you can enhance your
intelligence.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,940
And there are lots of websites, I'm not
going to give

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,790
them free advertising on here, but there
are lots of websites.

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,820
they typically fall under the title of
brain games that promote

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,369
this idea that you can enhance your
intelligence by doing Memory Training.

26
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,610
And again this is you can

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,630
do experimental research to answer this
question, so I'm using

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,610
the, the my sort of basic lingo from last
segment.

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,450
We could promote good stuff so if we know
why this happens, why we can enhance

30
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,510
memory and intelligence, perhaps we could
promote good

31
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,460
stuff by by doing this Memory Training
research.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,150
So the way an experiment works to get at
Memory Training is,

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,990
of course, the population we're talking
about here, just all healthy adults.

34
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,030
That's what I want to focus on.

35
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,788
so there are some brain training games or
Memory Training games focused at children.

36
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:32,461
what I'm going to talk about today in
this,

37
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:36,349
in this lecture are just some experiments
designed for

38
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,402
healthy adults.

39
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:40,885
So our sample in the sample from the
experiment that

40
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:44,773
I'm going to talk about, is just a sample
of college students.

41
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:47,090
So it's not exactly a random

42
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,470
representative sample of all healthy
adults.

43
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,920
college students aren't they're not
random.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,500
They're not completely representative.

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,940
but that's typically how research is done
because we

46
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,520
have, we can get our hands on them here

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,317
on a, on a college campus.

48
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,480
The way that these experiments are set

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,900
up is the independent variable is the
training

50
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,210
condition so whether you go through some

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,500
sort of memory training or whether you
don't.

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,089
And this is an interesting aspect of these
training experiments.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,420
what I'm going to describe to you in this
first example is a No training

54
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,640
control group, where the control group
just did nothing.

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,148
So there's Memory Training versus nothing.

56
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:36,508
there's other ways to do this that are
sort of

57
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:41,848
stronger tests of this claim that Memory
Training enhances intelligence.

58
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,370
but for now, we'll just keep it simple.

59
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,980
The dependent variables is the gain on an
IQ test.

60
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,650
So, as I mentioned, subjects in these
experiments, they take

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,220
an IQ test before training and then they
take an IQ test after training.

62
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,590
And we can look at the difference to see
how much

63
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,530
does an individual subject's IQ increase
as a function of training.

64
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,990
So the dependent variable here is IQ gain.
The idea being that subjects in

65
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:17,890
the training condition, their IQ is going
to increase more

66
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,164
so than subjects who are assigned to the
No training condition,

67
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:29,180
okay?
So the procedure in this one experiment

68
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,720
that I'll describe to you is the treatment
group, the, the Memory Training group.

69
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,880
They engaged in memory training for half
an hour a day, everyday for weeks.

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,399
I think it was up to like four weeks, four
or five weeks.

71
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,750
And I'll show you the training procedure
on the next slide.

72
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,920
and as mentioned, they, they took an IQ
test,

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,006
a reliable, standard measure of IQ, before
and after training.

74
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:53,600
Now, here's what the memory training
paradigm looked like,

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,827
if you're not familiar with the idea of
working

76
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:07,810
memory or short-term memory, this may look
a little

77
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,610
odd to you, so let me take some time

78
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,418
to explain it.
This task a 2-back task.

79
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,410
and very simply, what you're supposed to
do as the

80
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,120
student in this task or someone who's
engaging in this training paradigm,

81
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,920
as, you're going to see, stimulate popup
on the screen or you're going to hear

82
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,680
stimulate presented over headphones very

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,570
rapidly one at a time.

84
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,340
So you're going to see either locations,
squares,

85
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,130
excuse me, squares show up in different
locations

86
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,444
on a screen or you're going to hear

87
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:51,160
letters come, presented to you auditorally
over headphones.

88
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,180
And your job is just to press a button
when the

89
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,900
stimulus on the current slide, the one
that you see or

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,970
the one that you hear, matches the
stimulus end back in the stream.

91
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,365
And in this example, you're just doing a

92
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:10,670
2-back task, which is actually a pretty
easy task.

93
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,580
We could start with one-back, but that's
really, really simple.

94
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,095
so in a 2-back task, this one right here
is a visual

95
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:25,510
target because it's in the same location
as the stimulus 2-back in the stream.

96
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,930
Similarly in the auditory stream, this one
is an auditory target.

97
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,100
Because it matches the one 2-back in the
stream.

98
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,540
In this case, this is known as a dual end
back procedure.

99
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,640
The subject was supposed to press the
button only when the stimulus matched

100
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,100
in both the visual and auditory stream.
So again, this right here

101
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,140
is when the subject would press the
button,

102
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,600
saying yes, this stimulus matches the one
2-back up.

103
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,850
As I mentioned, subjects in a Memory
Training condition, they engaged in this

104
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:09,540
for this training procedure for half an
hour a day, everyday up to 19,

105
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,720
you can see 19 sessions down here in the
x-axis.

106
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,640
So what I'm plotting here on this graph
was on the x-axis

107
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,006
is session number so how many training
sessions

108
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:27,568
that they engaged in.
And what I'm plotting on the y-axis is the

109
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:32,750
min end back score.
So as you can see, people started out down

110
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,220
here around 3-back and as they engage

111
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,200
in training over 19 sessions, 19 days of
doing this for half an hour a day,

112
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,290
they got better and better and better up
to about 5-back.

113
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,778
Some people probably got as high as six
back, okay?

114
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:54,640
So, if you've done this task before, if

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,240
you have any familiarity with some of
these

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,990
brain game websites, 2-back is really
easy, 3-back

117
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,200
is sort of challenging, 4-back is really
challenging.

118
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,540
So the fact that these people got up to
5-back is pretty impressive.

119
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,360
So they're clearly training something.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,230
The jury is still out as to exactly what
they're training.

121
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,520
so some people argue they're training a

122
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
core memory capacity that's related to
intelligence.

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,720
other people would argue that m, they're
training they're

124
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,180
just getting faster at doing tasks online
or something else.

125
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,390
but these are some of the basic results
from this study.

126
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,930
The bigger question is whether there was
transfer to intelligence.

127
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,420
So people clearly get better at the task

128
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,689
that they're training in as they do the
training procedure every day.

129
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,744
the bigger question is whether those

130
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:53,360
people in the training condition got
better

131
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,560
on the intelligence test relative to a
control group that didn't do the training.

132
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,480
And here are the results from a study by
Jaeggi et al, the reference is here.

133
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,020
if you want to look it up, it's Jaeggi et
al, 2008.

134
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,520
Here is the

135
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,350
primary result from that study that caused
a lot of buzz and, and generated a lot

136
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,710
of attention in this area of research is,

137
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,360
if you look before the training, so what
I'm plotting here

138
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,040
on the x-axis is pre and post, so this is
just

139
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,100
time.
So, before training there's

140
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,750
no difference between the experimental
group and the

141
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,570
control group, that is between the Memory
Training

142
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,140
group and the true, the placebo group, if
you will, the group that did no training.

143
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,830
There's no difference in their
intelligence scores.

144
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,910
So what I'm, what I'm plotting here is
their score on an intelligence test.

145
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,461
But what you see after training, so, post
training, the group

146
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:06,366
that did the Memory Training procedure,
they gained more on the

147
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:12,330
IQ tests than did the group that didn't do
the training, the control group.

148
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,730
The control group went up a little.

149
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,520
That's probably just a practice effect.

150
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,920
They took this intelligence test before.

151
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,000
This is their second time taking it so
there's a little bit of a practice effect.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,480
But the bigger point is this difference
here.

153
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,510
The group that did the training gained
more

154
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,180
than the group that didn't do the
training.

155
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,410
So the conclusion from this experiment
then is engaging in this

156
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,350
memory training procedure, doing this end
back task for a half

157
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,790
an hour every day for 19 sessions, not
only enhances your

158
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,709
ability to do that end back task or
enhances your memory capacity.

159
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,620
But it also, according to these

160
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,970
authors, enhances your basic intelligence,
your general intelligence.

161
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,300
And that, of course, created a lot of
excitement in

162
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,210
the field of Psychology and Education
because the conventional wisdom

163
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,313
in those fields is that intelligence and
sort of a

164
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:11,110
memory capacity are sort of fixed once you
get to adulthood.

165
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,700
It's, they're very hard, it's very hard to
change your level IQ.

166
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,650
This result right here called all that
into question.

167
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,240
Now, as I said, the jury is still out on a

168
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,410
lot of these works so it's said here, it
doesn't really work.

169
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,830
there are lots of people who are

170
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:31,842
[UNKNOWN]

171
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:35,800
that does not work and this is, this is a
fluke result.

172
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,690
Jaeggi et al have follow, followed up on

173
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,428
this research and argued no, that this,
this

174
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:45,505
result is real and that you can engage

175
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:50,430
in this memory training task to enhance
intelligence.

176
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,170
my perspective on this, I do research in
this area, I

177
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,220
study working memory and intelligence is,
I would argue so far,

178
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,240
there's not enough evidence to suggest
that these things really work.

179
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,180
So if I were you, I would not go out to

180
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,390
these websites and spend any money on
these thing, not just yet.

181
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,700
I think we need more experimental research
to get at

182
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,800
to see if the, if these results are, are
really strong and if we can replicate

183
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,460
them with different kinds of Memory
Training paradigms and most

184
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,610
importantly, with better control groups.

185
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,540
So in this example, the control group did
nothing.

186
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,650
So that's a really poor control group.

187
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,300
So when you do experimental research, you
really want

188
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,890
the difference between the experimental
group and the control group

189
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,640
to be as small as possible so that you

190
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,096
can make that causal claim about why the
outcome happened.

191
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:48,040
You can link, you can

192
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,080
link it to the, that small difference

193
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,820
between the experimental group and the
control group.

194
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,770
Here there are so many things that were

195
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,750
different between the experimental group
and the control group.

196
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,880
The experimental group came to this lab
everyday for 19 days.

197
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,460
They got better on a task that they were
doing on a computer everyday.

198
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,580
So it was rewarding, they felt better
about themselves.

199
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,070
They had maybe just a more

200
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:18,540
positive feeling about this lab, about
cognitive tasks in general.

201
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,705
So when they came back for the post test
on the

202
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:24,390
IQ they could've just done better because
they felt better about themselves.

203
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:28,980
they could have felt better in that
environment.

204
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,650
there's all sorts of reasons why this
result could have happened.

205
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:39,540
that has nothing to do with memory
training per se, or IQ per se.

206
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,800
and if you're interested in this line of
research

207
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,070
again, Google, you can just Google working
memory training.

208
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,270
there's lots and lots of studies now, on
that, on that topic.

209
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,360
And I would argue that the evidence isn't

210
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,810
strong enough to claim that this really
works.

211
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,010
clearly, it doesn't work like the polio
vaccine work, all right?

212
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,890
So this is an example of experimental

213
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:10,220
research, that's not quite as good as, as
those polio vaccine studies.

214
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,870
If this is sort of not not sort

215
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,040
of high quality experimental research,
lots of potential confounds.

216
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,200
Okay.

217
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,390
So to, to summarize, this is the same
summary from Segment 1.

218
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,110
The major benefit of randomized controlled
experiments is that they allow for strong

219
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,980
claims about causality.

220
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,410
They allow us to get at mechanism, why
things happen.

221
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,900
again, we can predict stuff that allows us
to prevent bad stuff

222
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,860
like polio and potentially allows us to
promote good stuff like intelligence.

223
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,950
If we could use working memory training to

224
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,910
enhance intelligence, then great, that's a
great idea.

225
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,240
I think everybody's behind that idea but
not everybody believes that it

226
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,390
really works so far.

227
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:03,270
And I'm, I'm still pretty skeptical myself
And again, that's because

228
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,370
we need really good independent variables,
random and representative samples.

229
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,780
Again, that was another problem with that
study, it wasn't

230
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,305
truly a random representative sample of
all young adults, right?

231
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:16,770
There was college students.

232
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,412
and we need no confounds and there are
lots of potential

233
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:25,660
confounds I, I encourage you to post on
the discussion forums, your

234
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,970
own ideas of the potential confounds in,
in, in this line of research.

235
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,090
there's lots and lots of confounds that I
didn't mentioned here

236
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,400
but you could mention in the discussion
forums if you like.

237
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,970
so this is an example where it's true
experimental research.

238
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,420
It's true

239
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,210
that those subjects came to the lab.

240
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,110
They were randomly assigned to do either
training or no training.

241
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,310
And they were assessed on some dependent
measure.

242
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,940
So it's a nice example of a randomized
controlled experiment.

243
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,210
But it's, it's an ex, example of an
experiment that's not, that doesn't allow

244
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:12,819
for strong cause of claims yet because of
all these potential confounds,

245
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:21,203
unlike the polio vaccine example.
