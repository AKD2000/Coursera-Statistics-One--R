1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,880
Hi, welcome back to Statistics One.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,370
We're up to lecture 5, and the topic of
this lecture is correlation.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,620
This is a big topic in statistics.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,609
I'm sure you've heard lots about
correlations, or seen

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:18,820
correlations reported in the news or on
the Internet.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,970
Or perhaps in research studies.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,661
And this first lecture, I'm going to start
with

8
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:27,080
a broad overview, just to talk about the
concept.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,480
And then we'll do some actual

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,470
mathematical calculations.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,978
And then we'll talk about some

12
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:34,883
of the assumptions underlying
correlational analysis.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,420
So this lecture is split into three
segments.

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,060
As I said in the first segment, what I'd
like to do is

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,120
just give you a broad overview of the
concept of correlation and some examples.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,480
In the second segment, we'll walk

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,714
through the mathematical calculation of
the correlation

18
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:57,800
coefficient r, that's Pearson's product
moment correlation.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,190
Which I'll have a lot to say about in
segment two.

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,845
And then finally in segment three, we'll
talk about

21
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:08,010
some of the assumptions underlying a
typical correlation analysis.

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,690
So let's launch into segment one.

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,630
The important concepts and topics to take
away from this first segment.

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,190
This first, obviously, what is
correlation?

25
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,502
And then, what are they used for?

26
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:27,630
and we're also going to look at a lot of
scatterplots.

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,190
You saw some scatterplots in Lecture Two,
when

28
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,500
I talked about the method of correlational
studies.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,849
But now we'll really investigate
scatterplots and look at all the details.

30
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:39,824
then there's

31
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,370
a lot of words of caution.

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,805
[LAUGH]

33
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:45,820
So, I can talk about what are correlations
used to do?

34
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,708
And I'm, and with the caution I'm going to
say

35
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,998
what are correlations not supposed to be
used for?

36
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:57,830
so we'll go through a lot of a lot of
cautionary notes toward the end.

37
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,478
And then I'll just list some other types
of correlations beyond the

38
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,420
Pearson product moment correlation which
is the one we're going to emphasize today.

39
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,750
So first, what is a correlation procedure?

40
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,305
It's just a statistical analysis used to

41
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:19,120
measure or describe the relationship
between two variables.

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,950
Correlation coefficients can range between
positive 1 and negative 1.

43
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,230
A positive one indicates a perfect
positive correlation.

44
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,200
A negative 1 indicates a perfect negative
correlation.

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,590
0 of course, indicates there's no
relationship at all.

46
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,250
That's independence.

47
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,361
So perfect positive correlation means, as
the scores on one

48
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:42,960
variable go up, the scores on the other
variable go up.

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,910
Perfect negative correlation would be, as
the scores go up

50
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,680
on one variable, the scores go down on the
other.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,490
And I'll show you exa, examples of that in
scatterplots.

52
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,507
It's best to just look at it in a
scatterplot.

53
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,270
So, what are they used for?

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,563
Well, we've already seen some, uses of
correlation in lecture 2.

55
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,944
Very simply, if we have two variables,
let's call

56
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,855
them X and Y, and they're correlated, if I
know

57
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:14,050
an individual's value on X, then I can
predict their

58
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,062
score on Y, particularly if there's a very
strong correlation.

59
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:21,760
And there're lots of these examples that

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,310
you're probably familiar with.
one is IQ and academic achievement.

61
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,550
Right?

62
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,656
So if you're high on IQ, and I know that,
then

63
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:34,897
I'm going to predict you're probably going
to do pretty well in school.

64
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:38,693
some newer research is coming out which is
very interesting is

65
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:44,260
socioeconomic status in very young kids is
also correlated with academic achievement.

66
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,906
So if I know socioeconomic status, I might
be able

67
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:50,301
to predict academic achievement years
later.

68
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:52,071
once we know that, hopefully we can

69
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:54,910
do something to intervene with that
relationship.

70
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,700
Right?

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,452
So, that's what correlation is mainly used
for,

72
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:02,100
to describe relationships and then, it's
used for predictions.

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,200
Which leads us to the next topic,
regression.

74
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,280
So, let's go back to this example of
working memory capacity and intelligence.

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,450
So I've mentioned that this is my area of
expertise in my own research.

76
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,874
And in the first lecture on experimental
designs, we talked about

77
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:27,080
this study and this whole sort of
literature that's booming right now.

78
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,090
It's actually an industry that's booming
online.

79
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,546
Where people are trying to train their
working memory to enhance

80
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:37,770
their intelligence.
Well, where did that idea come from?

81
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,150
Well, it came from years of research.

82
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,510
Some if it done by my graduate adviser,
Randy Ingle.

83
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,870
Some of it done by myself and my
colleagues showing that.

84
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,650
Scores on tests of working memory capacity
are highly

85
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,470
correlated with traditional standardized
tests of intelligence or IQ.

86
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,838
So we know that working

87
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,670
memory is correlated with IQ.

88
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,795
So if I know a person's IQ, then I could
predict how well they're

89
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:09,830
going to do in my lab when they come and
take a working memory task.

90
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,010
So here is an example of a scatterplot
illustrating that correlation.

91
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,055
This is actually really strong
correlation.

92
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:25,595
We exaggerated it to make it clear that
it's a very strong positive correlation.

93
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:30,890
What we're looking at a correlation
between intelligence and working memory.

94
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,290
So on the x axis, I have IQ scores.

95
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,760
And you'll notice that they're
standardized, right?

96
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,135
They're standardized on that z scale.
And I know that, because the mean is 0.

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,220
The same thing is true of the working
memory task.

98
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,685
So the working memory task in this example
is the N-back task.

99
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:58,963
That was the task that was used in that
experimental example that

100
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:04,332
I described back in lecture one, where
subjects had to do that N-back

101
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:08,760
task every day for, for weeks.
That was their working memory training.

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,810
So the N-back task is a measure of working
memory capacity.

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,274
But more importantly what this shows is
each

104
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:19,718
dot in the scatterplot, each dot is an
individual

105
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:22,342
and the line that runs through the dots

106
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:26,760
is called the regression line or the
prediction line.

107
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,378
And it just runs right through the middle

108
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:32,820
of that scatterplot.
And what this shows is.

109
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,956
If, you know, if you're above average on
IQ, then

110
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:42,330
you tend to be above average on working
memory capacity.

111
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,980
That's a positive correlation, and it's a
pretty strong positive correlation.

112
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,380
If you see up here, little r is 0.8.

113
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,572
We're going to, in the next segment, I'll
show you how to calculate

114
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:58,212
that little r, but just for now, know that
that's a really high correlation

115
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:04,668
coefficient.
It's actually rare that we seem that high.

116
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:09,102
Now here's where all the cautionary notes
and tales come in.

117
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:11,811
the first one is one that you've all heard
before,

118
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,790
but to me it's not really the most
important one.

119
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,040
I've put it first because I know most
people are familiar with it.

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,390
So we know that correlation does not imply
causation.

121
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,890
Well, let's unpack that.
What does that mean?

122
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,380
It means that working memory capacity
doesn't cause intelligence.

123
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,420
And likewise, intelligence doesn't cause
working memory capacity.

124
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,712
There could be intervening variables, most
likely there are lots of

125
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:39,264
intervening variables associated with the
brain,

126
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:42,880
particularly prefrontal cortex and
parietal cortex.

127
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,550
We know there's certain regions that are
very important for working memory.

128
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,730
And for intelligence.

129
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,134
so we can't say from this correlational
study, that one causes the other.

130
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:58,430
they're just related, we know that they're
correlated, there's an association there.

131
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,570
So, correlation does not imply causation.
A great example my assistant

132
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,065
[INAUDIBLE]

133
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,060
came up with.

134
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,206
Is going to bed with your boots on is

135
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:10,070
correlated with hanging, having a headache
in the morning.

136
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,610
[LAUGH]

137
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,230
That's an association.

138
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,561
It doesn't mean having your boots on
caused

139
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,018
the headache, what's more likely is that
you

140
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:22,560
were drunk and fell asleep with your boots
on and were hung over in the morning.

141
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,755
And that's why you had the headache.

142
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:29,106
There're lots of fun examples of this if
you Google correlation and fun examples.

143
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:32,110
so I think we all know that correlation
does not imply causation.

144
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:40,644
More importantly, and this is what I'm
going to focus on in lecture six

145
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:48,080
primarily, is the magnitude of a
correlation depends on a lot of factors.

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,520
Including sampling, which we've already
talked about.

147
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,930
That idea of getting a random and
representative sample.

148
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,636
It also depends critically on measurement
of

149
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:02,180
your variables, so measurement of x and y.

150
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,930
Specifically, do you have reliable
measures?

151
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,990
And do you have valid measures?

152
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,800
So for example, in the intelligence
literature.

153
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,600
We need to know that we have reliable

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,420
assessments of intelligence, we need, we
need to know

155
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,660
that they're valid assessments of
intelligence, in order for

156
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,290
us to make any sense of the correlation
analysis.

157
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,690
So we're going to spend a lot of time
talking about that in lecture 6.

158
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,850
For now, let's just look at one of these
assumptions.

159
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,320
The idea that we have random and
representative sampling.

160
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,156
So, I showed you that there's a strong
correlation

161
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:41,350
between working memory capacity and
intelligence in healthy young adults.

162
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,370
And I've seen that in my own research.

163
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,580
It's been replicated many, many times

164
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,350
over the last couple of decades, but
that's if we look at all young,

165
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,450
healthy adults.
If we get a heterogeneous sample.

166
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,418
Of say, all high school graduates.
What if we relied on a more convenient

167
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:04,710
sample, let's say, a prestigious selective
school of higher

168
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,590
education like Princeton.
and we might want to

169
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:16,310
ask, what is the correlation between IQ
and working

170
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,570
memory among college graduates?
It's a different kind of sample.

171
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,550
So let's look at that scatterplot.
This is a bit exaggerated again.

172
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,022
We made up the data.

173
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:31,990
but now you'll see the correlation is not
very strong.

174
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,610
It's only 0.2.
And why is that?

175
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:42,053
Well, if you look at the IQ distribution,
again we exaggerated this.

176
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:47,040
But everybody's above average on IQ
because they're college graduates.

177
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,176
They were selected into college most
likely on the basis

178
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:55,756
of some sort of standardized tests like an
IQ test.

179
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,920
so this is not that far-fetched.

180
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,734
And, actually, in my own research, I did
look at

181
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:04,084
the relationship between working memory
and intelligence

182
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,898
in a selective institution, not Princeton,
and

183
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:12,270
the correlation was 0.22, where I'm used
to finding a correlation of about 0.66.

184
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,230
This is known as attenuation of
correlation due

185
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,270
to restriction of range in one of your
variables.

186
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,970
So the fact that we only have this really
smart people restricts our range.

187
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,684
In other words,

188
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,580
it restricts our variance.

189
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,390
Which doesn't allow for us to find
covariance.

190
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,700
And finally is, is the last cautionary
note.

191
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,760
And it's perhaps the most important for
general consumers of statistics.

192
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,700
And particularly correlations.

193
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,560
Is a lot of people get upset when they
hear.

194
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,660
Let's say you know, your score on some
standardized test predicts how well you're

195
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,840
going to do in college.
but it's only a sample statistic.

196
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,335
A correlation coefficient

197
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:04,190
is a sample statistic just like a mean is
a sample statistic.

198
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,000
And it may not be representative Of
everyone

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,798
in the sample, unless the correlation is
1.0.

200
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:15,297
Alright, so, I, I'm, I'm a perfect example
of this.

201
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:19,368
when I took the standardized tests here in
the US, they're called the

202
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:23,301
SAT, I scored really well on the math and
really poor on the verbal,

203
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:23,646
[LAUGH]

204
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:26,040
that's why I'm a statistics teacher.

205
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,136
[LAUGH]

206
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:32,170
and in school I tended to have very high
grades in math and science.

207
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,550
But not so high in things like history and

208
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,970
language despite the fact that those
things are correlated, right?

209
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,470
If you go back to lecture two on
correlational studies we saw that this was

210
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:53,190
the example I used for a moderate
correlation between say math and language.

211
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,835
So, if you look at the dots, you see that
on average,

212
00:12:56,835 --> 00:13:00,320
as you go up on one, you go up on the
other.

213
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,890
But let's say this is math, and let's say
this is history.

214
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,640
You know, I was like this guy out here.

215
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,280
[LAUGH]

216
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,392
Off the charts on math, but really below
average on history.

217
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:22,908
frankly because at that age, I didn't have

218
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:26,492
the patience to sit down and read long
texts.

219
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:30,480
so I didn't do very well in things like
History or, or English.

220
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,195
It wasn't quite that low, maybe about
there but the point is.

221
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:37,670
as you go up on one, as, on average, as

222
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,370
people go up one one score, they go up on
the

223
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,220
other score, that's a positive
correlation.

224
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,830
But, it may not be represented if for
every individual in the sample, okay.

225
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,768
That's one of the most important things

226
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:54,409
to take away from thinking about
correlations.

227
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,705
This final note is, there're several types
of correlation coefficients,

228
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:04,170
depending on the types of variables that
you're looking at.

229
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,166
So, go back to lecture three, where we
talked about types of variables.

230
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,938
I'm going to emphasize this one right
here,

231
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:17,000
the Pearson product-moment correlation
coefficient, or little r.

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,992
That's what we're going to focus on in the
next segment.

233
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,040
and that's the most common one.

234
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,210
Because it, it provides us with the most
amount of information.

235
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,570
We have a continuous variable x and a
continuous variable

236
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,730
y and we can look at the correlation
between the two.

237
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,715
If one of our variables is continuous and
one is dichotomous, it's just 0

238
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:41,420
or 1 Then there's a different coefficient,

239
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,310
it's called the point bi-serial
correlation function.

240
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,186
Also if we have

241
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,814
two dichotomous variables, if both x and y

242
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:54,540
are dichotomous, then we'll calculate the
Phi coefficient.

243
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,880
And if we have both X and Y as ranked or

244
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,688
ordinal variables, then we can calculate

245
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:04,080
what's called the Spearman rank-order
correlation.

246
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm just listing these here so that you're
aware of them.

247
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,225
For now, since this is just an intro stats

248
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,470
course, we're going to focus on just the
Pearson product-moment

249
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,050
correlation, little r.

250
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,860
It's by far the most common one that
you'll see, that you'll encounter.

251
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,036
But just remember and for your own

252
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:22,730
knowledge, know that there are other
types.

253
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,420
And it depends on what kinds of variables
you're looking at.

254
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,563
So to sum up this, this segment, we talked
about

255
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,500
just, what is a correlation, what are they
used for.

256
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,530
We're going to look at scatter plots a lot
when we're talking about correlations.

257
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,011
There's a lot of cautionary notes that you
have to keep in mind and then

258
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:44,315
remember, there're different types of
correlations depending

259
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:46,947
on the types of variables that you're
analyzing.

260
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,196
And that wraps up this segment.

261
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:48,251
