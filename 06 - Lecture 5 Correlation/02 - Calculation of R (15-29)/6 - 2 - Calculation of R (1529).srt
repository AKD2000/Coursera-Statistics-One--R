1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,010
Hi and welcome back.
We're up to lecture 5, segment 2.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,850
In this segment, we're going to walk
through the

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,580
mathematical calculations of the
correlation coefficient little r.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,830
So, when it comes to the important topics
for this segment, that's about it.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,170
Just knowing how to do this calculation,
I'm

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,040
going to show you two different ways to do
it.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,270
One I refer to as the raw score formula,
and the

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,030
other I refer to as the Z score formula.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,700
But in the end I'll show you that they're
equivalent.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,400
There's actually just one new concept
here.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,610
There's a lot of math that's going to come
at you in this segment.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,910
The one new concept is sum of cross
products and covariance.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,180
And I'll illustrate that through the
calculations.

14
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:52,890
So first this is more of a conceptual

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,510
presentation of the formula, not a
mathematical presentation.

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,060
But just conceptually what little r is,
what the correleation is.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,380
Is it's the degree to which X and Y vary
together, relative to the degree

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:15,360
to which X and Y vary independently.
So, we could rewrite that down below as

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,550
the covarience of X and Y.

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,820
And again, I'll get to that when we do the
calculations.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,700
Over the variance of X and the variance of
Y.

22
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,360
Now as I mentioned there's two ways,
there's more than two ways.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,175
We're just going to show, I'm just
going to show you

24
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,230
two; the raw score formula and the Z-score
formula.

25
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,651
We'll start with the raw score formula.

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,430
To illustrate this, it's actually really
easy.

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,810
If you followed along in Lecture 4 and the
calculation of summary statistics.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,850
Particularly the calculation of variance.

29
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,470
So remember, variance is equal to standard
deviation squared.

30
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,350
Another way that we write that is mean
squares.

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,210
Because it's the sum of squares over N or

32
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,380
the average sum of squares mean squares is
variance.

33
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,610
It's also standard deviation squared.

34
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,770
Let's review the calculation of variance
from that lecture 4, remember

35
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,899
I used the example of Jeremy Lin, this was
to Linsanity.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,610
thing that swept New York during the NBA
season, not this year, the year prior.

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,970
and I use this to illustrate not only how
many points per game

38
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,120
was Jeremy Lin averaging during those ten
games, but what was his variability?

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,640
So remember we calculated the mean, we
calculated the standard deviation,

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,750
we calculated the variance.
The way we did that is, I listed out the

41
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,120
points per game across ten games, and then
that first column, points per game.

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,770
To get the mean, we just sum that column,
and divide by the number of games.

43
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,310
So it's the sum of X divided by N, that's
just the average.

44
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,500
So during those ten games Jeremy Lin was
averaging 22.7 points per game.

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,470
To calculate variance, we then have to
look at each individual

46
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,560
game and see how much is he differing from
his average.

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,050
So this middle column is what we call
deviation scores.

48
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,950
We just take points per game for that one
row, and subtract out his mean.

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,600
So the first

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,386
one is 28 minus the mean, 22.7, which is
5.3.

51
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:36,460
We go down, do that for each row.

52
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,380
We can't sum and take the average of the
deviation scores,

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,670
because they sum to zero, so the average
would be zero.

54
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,030
So, to fix that problem, we just square
all

55
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,910
the deviation scores, and that's the third
column, right?

56
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,620
So, then, we square every deviation

57
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,802
score, sum those, and that's that.
That phrase, sums of squares.

58
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:59,060
It's going to be a really important

59
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,610
concept going forward throughout the
course.

60
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,000
This number down here, sums of squares, is

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,130
922, divided by ten because there are ten
games.

62
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,500
That gives me means squares; that's
variance.

63
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,430
So, to summarize the results, his mean, or
average points per game during that time

64
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,910
was 22.7.
His variance or mean squares was 92.21.

65
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,040
That's not that meaningful of a number.

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,620
So let's take the square root of that to
get us

67
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,610
back into the units of points per game,
that's the standard deviation.

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,870
He was deviating on average about 9.6.

69
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,920
Remember that's a little inflated because
I included

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,000
that one game where he scored just two
points.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,550
He didn't start.

72
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,830
remember back in lecture 4 we eliminated
that

73
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,340
and the standard deviation was a little
lower.

74
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,350
But that's the calculation of variance.

75
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,240
And sum the squares.

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,330
To calculate a correlation coefficient,
all we have to do is

77
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,785
add that one new concept, sum of cross
products, and then covariance.

78
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,950
So to review, how do we get sum of the
squares?

79
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,830
For each row in that data frame.

80
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,750
We calculated the deviation score, then we

81
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,920
squared each deviation score, then we
summed them.

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,250
Sums of squares.

83
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,100
To calculate sums of cross products.

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,570
Remember now we have two variables,
because we're

85
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,544
looking at the correlation between X and
Y.

86
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:35,780
So we're going to calculate the deviation
score on x, the deviation score on y.

87
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,340
And take the product of those, and sum
those products.

88
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,070
That's the sum of cross products, or SP.

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,830
So written out mathematically, for each
row I'm going to multiply the deviation

90
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,900
score on X by the deviation score on Y.
And then I'm going to sum them.

91
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,280
So here is the formula for sums of cross
products.

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,130
Sum of cross products, excuse me.

93
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,860
This is something that you should know and
be

94
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,080
able to calculate off the top of your
head.

95
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,420
So now, let's look at the formula for the

96
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,090
correlation coefficient, again I'm
going to do this two ways.

97
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,370
First, the raw score formula.

98
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,080
So the raw score formula written in its
simplest form, is just the sum of cross

99
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,650
products over the square root of sum to
the squares X times sum to the squares Y.

100
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,260
Remember, go back to the conceptual
definition of the correlation

101
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,190
coefficient, it's the degree to which X
and Y vary together.

102
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,890
That sum of cross products.

103
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,120
Relative to the degree to which they vary
independently, and that's captured

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,030
by sum of the squares x, and sum of the
squares y.

105
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,560
So, hopefully you can see the concept

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,380
there, now that we're moving into the
math.

107
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,120
If I unpack that, and write it in longer
form, here's the sum.

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,650
Of cross products which we just saw, it's
just the deviation score on

109
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,260
X times the deviation score on Y, sum them
all.

110
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,560
Likewise, we've summed the scores x,
summed the scores y.

111
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,020
Those are just the same old sums of
squares that we

112
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,430
did when we're calculating variance by in
the summary statistics lecture.

113
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,240
So now I can open up this formula, here is
the raw score formula again,

114
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:32,430
and it's simple form, but now it's written
out in long form.

115
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,540
And I am doing that because I want to show
you.

116
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,900
That it's going to wind up being exactly
the same as the Z score formula.

117
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,960
But this is just the same formula written
out in longhand.

118
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,700
So this top part here.

119
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:54,159
That's the sum of cross products.
This part here, that's sums of squares x.

120
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,250
This part here.

121
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,400
That sum of the square is Y.
Right?

122
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
So these two are just equivalent.

123
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,000
Now let's look at the Z-score formula.
I'm going to do the same thing.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,050
Start with it in a simple form, unpack it,
and then

125
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,410
show you how it's the same thing as the
raw score formula.

126
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,880
So if we start with Z scores, remember
any, any scale, any

127
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,860
score can, can be converted to the Z scale
and Z scores.

128
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,910
So if we have everything in Z score

129
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,140
form, then this is the formula for
correlation coefficient.

130
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,720
It's just the sum of the product of the Z
scores.

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,480
Divided by N.

132
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,770
So again, now, what I'm doing is unpacking
that, writing things out in longer form.

133
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,960
Remember, how do we get a Z score?

134
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Well, it's the raw score minus the mean
divided by the standard deviation.

135
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,248
So, that's just these first two.

136
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:55,450
Minds and then how do we get standard
deviation?

137
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,110
Well, first we can get variants, that's
these guys,

138
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,330
right?

139
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,640
It's the sum of squares divided by N or
mean

140
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,510
squares, then take the square root of
that, that's standard deviation.

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,580
So here's the final proof of equivalence.
If I write the Z score formula out in

142
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:24,150
really long form, then what I have is X
minus M of X.

143
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:31,320
So, X minus the mean of X, over standard
deviation, written in long form.

144
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,910
So this whole piece is just standard
deviation of x.

145
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,640
This whole piece is just standard
deviation of y.

146
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,130
Now, let's write it in its really tedious
long form.

147
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,990
Again, this is just sort of packing and
unpacking algebra.

148
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,370
So if it's been a while since you've done
this, maybe just review these slides.

149
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,750
A few times.

150
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,880
for those of you who have, who are really
familiar

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,540
with just basic algebraic manipulations,
this is, this is review.

152
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,270
But if, if it's been a while, or if it's
just new to you, just review these slides.

153
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,820
I, I promise you, they work out

154
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,110
[LAUGH]

155
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,930
that they're equivalent.

156
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,460
so now, what I've done is this is the
really long form.

157
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:26,580
So what we have in the numerator is this
whole piece is just Z of x.

158
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,690
I'm going to multiply it by Z of y and
just divide by n.

159
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,280
That was the original formula in short
form, right, is Z

160
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,220
of X times Z of Y, divided by N.

161
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,650
So here it is again at the top.

162
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,730
So this top part is exactly what you saw
in the last slide.

163
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,300
Now, to go from this first piece here To
this second formula.

164
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,960
All I've done is, again, I've reduced some
of

165
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,660
the terms just by applying basic rules of
algebra.

166
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,860
So if you see,

167
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,720
in this top formula, we have n in both the
numerator and the denominator.

168
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,500
So those can cancel out.

169
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,400
So we can reduce that formula at the top
to this formula in the middle.

170
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
And if you take a close look at

171
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,780
that formula in the middle, it's sort of
cool, right?

172
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,020
Because it's sums of squares, excuse me.

173
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,370
It's sum of cross products

174
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,370
[LAUGH]

175
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,110
in the numerator.
And then sums of squares for X and sums of

176
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,290
squares for Y in the denominator.
Which, remember is

177
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,981
the raw score formula, so sum as, sum of
cross products is right

178
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:52,640
here, sum as square as X is right here

179
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,210
and sum as square as Y is right here.

180
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,970
Remember, go back to the very beginning of

181
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,260
the math segment, that was the raw score
formula.

182
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,430
So we started with the raw score formula
in simple

183
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,740
form, unpacked it, went to the Z score
formula, unpacked it.

184
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,720
And brought it all the way back to the

185
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,630
raw score formula, to show they're the
same thing.

186
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,170
They're going to give you the same exact
number.

187
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,500
The correlation coefficent.

188
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,490
So finally, this concept of covariance is
really important.

189
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,220
And one that we'll use throughout his
course.

190
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,640
and something that you just need to

191
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,210
have fundamental understanding of, to
understand basic statistics.

192
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:43,110
So just as in summary statistics I, I, I
emphasize moving beyond just measures

193
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,390
of central tendency like the mean.
And embracing measures of variability,

194
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,330
like variance.

195
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,960
Here too, you need to sort of push
yourself to another level

196
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,550
and say, Okay, well, I know what variance
is, but what is covariance?

197
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,840
You need to be able to just look at these

198
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,960
formulas and, 1, conceptually get them
and, 2, mathematically unpack them.

199
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,310
So to recap, variance is mean squares
because

200
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,700
it's the sum of the squares divided by n.

201
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,740
It's a very simply analogy to covariance,
right?

202
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,300
Covariance, I'm just going to use COV for
covariance

203
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,980
is the sum of cross products divided by n.

204
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,349
Just instead of sum of squares it's sum of
cross products.

205
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,750
And then, correlation is just standardized
covariance.

206
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,420
So that the correlation coefficient fits
between positive one

207
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,140
and negative one, in the same way that
standard deviation

208
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,100
is standardized variance.
Okay?

209
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,010
So variance to standard deviation is
analogous to covariance to correlation.

210
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,190
And finally you might of noticed if you've
been really sharp.

211
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,930
We still have this issue of when to divide
by N, when to divide by N minus 1.

212
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,610
Again this came up in the summary
statistics lecture.

213
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,950
If you're just doing descriptive
statistics,

214
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,910
technically the rule is divide by n.

215
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,710
As we launch in to inferential statistics,
which will be

216
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,870
next week, as we look into, as we start
multiple regression.

217
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,450
When you do inferential statistics, we're
going to divide by n minus 1.

218
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,490
And when we start inferential statistics
in, in the regression

219
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,240
lecture, I, I'll discuss that issue a
little bit more.

220
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,470
But for now, just, if you are doing
descriptive divide

221
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,690
by n, if you are doing inferential, divide
by n-1.

222
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,400
So the summarize, just know how to
calculate this

223
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,010
correlation coefficient, its really
important to know that math

224
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,500
just like you know how to calculate an
average.

225
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,830
It should be clear.

226
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,260
Hopefully, the concepts come through as
you do the math I've been teaching

227
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,920
Intro Stats a long time, and a lot of
students tell me that.

228
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,650
As they actually walk through the
calculations

229
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,690
for correlation and for even more advanced
analyses.

230
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,470
The concepts start to come through as they
crunch the numbers.

231
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,510
So, if this is new to, or if it's been
awhile, challenge yourself and

232
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,910
do it, and review those slides.

233
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,910
and again, the most important new concept
is sum of cross products.

234
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,990
And covariance.
