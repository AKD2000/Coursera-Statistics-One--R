1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,350
Hi, welcome back to Statistics One, we're
up

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,440
to lecture eight, and the topic of lecture
eight,

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,840
is Null Hypothesis Significance Testing,
which is a, a

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,280
fundamental topic in statistics and a
somewhat controversial topic.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,210
so we will talk about the basic logic of
null

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,890
hypothesis significance testing in the
first segment in this lecture.

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,690
And then in the second segment,

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,150
I'll talk about why it's controversial,
why there

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,390
are some problems with it, and then we'll

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,800
talk about some of the remedies that you

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,450
can apply, to deal with some of those
problems.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,470
So this lecture we'll just have two
segments.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,210
As I said, we, the first segment,I'll

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,650
just give an overview, introduce the, the
process

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,480
of NHST and then in the second segment,

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,880
we'll talk about why it's such a
controversy

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,740
and, we'll talk about the problems and
then ,how you can address those problems.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,740
So first an overview.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,089
Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, when
I, when I teach undergrads statistics

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,010
I refer to as a game, it's a game we play,
as scientists who do research.

21
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,670
not all of us play this game, there are

22
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,410
many scientists out there, especially in
the last decade

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,610
or so, who have argued very vehemently
that we

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,460
should stop playing this game and that we
should ban

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,750
null hy-, null hypothesis significance
testing, from all

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,470
of scientific research, because they argue
it's very misleading.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,470
I don't take that position, I'm, I'm not,
I, I

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,830
don't describe myself as pro NHST, but I'm
also not anti-NHST.

29
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,450
I think if it's taught appropriately,
which hopefully we can

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,670
do in this lecture and you understand what
it can

31
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,900
do, and what it can't do then you'll be
fine.

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,260
so let's talk about how it works.

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,812
And again, it's nice to think of it as, as
a game.

34
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:10,900
This is a game we're playing, as we're
conducting our research.

35
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,372
So before we conduct a study or an
experiment, we set up two hypotheses.

36
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:22,080
One I'll call the null hypothesis, and
that's just H sub zero.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,830
So if were doing say a cor-relational
analysis,

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,500
the null hypothesis will just be R equal
0.

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,310
The alternative hypothesis would be say,
I'm

40
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,130
expecting or predicting a positive
correlation, so R

41
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,370
is going to be greater than zero, that's
the

42
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,660
alternative, so this is how the game
starts.

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,950
Step one, Identify the null hypothesis and
the alternative hypothesis.

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,880
We could do this in

45
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,980
regression as well, so here the null
hypothesis is

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,680
that, the regression coefficient, the
slope between x and

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,143
y, is 0, and the alternative is that, it's

48
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,870
positive our hypothesis is, we're
predicting a positive relationship.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,520
if the alternative hypothesis is, it
predicts

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,040
the direction of the relationship in a
correlation

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,900
or regression analysis, as I just showed
you

52
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,940
there, then those are known as directional
tests.

53
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,760
We could be more agnostic about, what
might happen in a study or an

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,290
experiment, and not predict the direction,
so that's known as a non-directional test.

55
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,580
you might have heard

56
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,630
of these before, the directional test is
sometimes referred to

57
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,540
as a one-tailed test, and the
non-directional, a two tailed test.

58
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,630
We'll talk about why that is in the next
lecture.

59
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:57,840
So, again, here would be the setup for a
non-directional test in regression.

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,370
So the null is still that, the

61
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,160
regression coefficient is zero, but now,
the alternative

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,180
is that it's just not equal to zero.

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,040
It could be positive, it could be a
negative, and that exclamation point

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,140
equals, remember, that's how we that's the
notation for not equal to, in R.

65
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,520
So I'm going to use that, I'm going to
start to sneak R

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,460
notation into the lectures, now that
you're getting familiar with, with R.

67
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:28,600
So step one of the game, is we

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,020
just state the null hypothesis, state the
alternative hypothesis.

69
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,065
Then going in to our study, this is the
weird part, one of the weird parts

70
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,400
[LAUGH]

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,920
we have to assume that the null is true,
then do our study,

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,800
calculate all our statistics and then,
reassess that assumption.

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,550
That's sort of odd and backwards and this
is why critics of

74
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,140
null hypothesis significance testing, say
it's

75
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,160
just that, a weird approach to science.

76
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,278
because very rarely are we predicting
nothing, right?

77
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:07,730
Very rarely do we develop theories

78
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,030
that predict no relationship between two
variables.

79
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,260
you know, Jonas Salk didn't predict that
his vaccine wouldn't work, so it's rare

80
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,009
that we're looking for no relationship, so
it's a little bit weird and backwards.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,290
but, anyway, that's how it's going to
work.

82
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,070
We're going to assume the null is true,
through our study,

83
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,060
calculate some statistics and then, we can
estimate the probability of observing

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,170
the data that we did observe, given that
initial assumption that the null is true.

85
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,090
That gives us a p value at the end, and if
you're, if you've had any

86
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,430
exposure to research, or, or just reading,
about

87
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,480
research studies online, or in the news,
you'll often

88
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,480
hear this phrase, the relationship was

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,780
statistically significant, p less than
0.05.

90
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,250
That's where that this is where that comes
from.

91
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,090
So if we get a very low p value for
example less than point 05.

92
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,430
So if the probability of obtaining the
data we obtained, given

93
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,620
the assumption that nothing was going to
happen, if that probability is so

94
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,490
low like less than 5% chance, then we
reject the

95
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,150
null, and we say, hey it looks like the
null

96
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,660
hypothesis is, was wrong, looks like there
is an effect

97
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,240
here, there is a relationship between X
and Y, for example.

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,700
So that's how the game works.

99
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,930
And if you play this game, you have to be
prepared for

100
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,720
one of these four outcomes.
So strictly speaking,

101
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,510
if you're doing an NHST, you're going to
wind up in one of these four boxes.

102
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,050
So the way I demonstrate this in, in my
undergrad

103
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,240
class is At Princeton, is think of these
two rows

104
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,370
in this table which I've labeled" Truth,"
sort of like the truth is out there.

105
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,480
We don't know what the truth is.

106
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,110
That's why we're doing the research.

107
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,450
We don't know if the null is true or if
the null is false.

108
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,770
We don't know.
so that's why we're doing this.

109
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,550
So the truth is out there.

110
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,750
so we have to, so think of these two rows,
as alternate universes.

111
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,740
They can't coexist, so either the null is
true or it's false.

112
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,060
So, we we either live in the world that's
represented by row

113
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,930
one, or we live in the world that, that
represented by row two.

114
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,660
Those, those are mutually exclusive
different worlds, okay?

115
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,960
Think, think about the columns sort of
differently, the

116
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,990
columns are, are what we do, as the
experiment

117
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,870
or as the researcher we have to make a

118
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,690
decision based on that P value, based on
our data.

119
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,600
We are either going to decide to retain
the null or reject the null.

120
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
We have to make one, we have to make this
binary decision.

121
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,750
Again, that's one of the things that
people don't like about

122
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,110
this, is that sort of strict decision
rule, you have to

123
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,900
reject or retain, that's it, but, that's
how the game works.

124
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,560
So, you retain or you reject.

125
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,680
So, you're going to wind up in one of
these four outcomes.

126
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,880
So, if you retain when the null is true,
great you made the correct decision.

127
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,130
Likewise, if you reject when the null

128
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,980
is false, great you made the correct
decision.

129
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,850
But there's always

130
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,890
the possibility of an error, and there are
two types of errors.

131
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,440
The first is a type one error, or, or
false alarm.

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,090
That's where you've rejected the Null
Hypothesis, when in fact, there

133
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,230
wasn't a relationship there, that's why
its called a false alarm.

134
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,020
That's like doing a, a vaccination study
and claiming

135
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,590
that the vaccine works, when in fact, it
really doesn't,

136
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,330
sometimes that happens.
Sometimes there are fluke results or if

137
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,740
you do a, a, test a new drug to see if it,
it's effective in treating, say, HIV.

138
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,380
And you might get an initial result that
looks good, and say, hey, this drug works.

139
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,410
But then, as you do more

140
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,050
research, get more representative samples,
better assessments.

141
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,540
You might found out, hey it doesn't work,
so that will be a type one error.

142
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,010
There is also the possibility of a type
two error, and that's called the miss.

143
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,750
So, there's really an effect out there,

144
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,000
and you just missed it, for whatever
reason.

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,080
Maybe you've had poor assessment, maybe
you didn't have

146
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,220
enough subjects you, you didn't have a
random representative sample.

147
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,810
For whatever reason, you may have missed
it.

148
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,430
So there's always the possibility of a
type one error or

149
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,840
a type two error, and we have to live with
that.

150
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,190
Because research

151
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,700
is messy a lot of the time, and we're
doing

152
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,120
this inference process where we're getting
a sample from a population.

153
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,020
So we're engaged in this est, these
estimation procedures.

154
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,520
there's a lot of probabilistic outcomes.

155
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,310
So, we just have to be comfortable with
the fact that, we might make mistakes

156
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,250
in individual studies, but that's okay
because we do lots

157
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,905
of studies.

158
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:28,690
Alright, you don't do one experiment and
then, say hey, you know,

159
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,460
this vaccine works, or this drug works, it
takes multiple studies, replications.

160
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,264
So, if you're uneasy with this, and the
fact that

161
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:41,840
we're going to make errors sometimes,
remember that, we're going to to

162
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,660
do lots of experiments, or lots of
studies, or if

163
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,420
you're a consumer of statistics and
research look for replications.

164
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,380
never base a, a conclusion on one

165
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,390
individual study, because they're prone to
these errors.

166
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,140
So to be clear and this is one of the most
important

167
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,800
things I, I, I tell my undergraduate
students to walk away from

168
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,420
my course with is, knowing that the p
value that you see

169
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,350
In the news or in a research paper, or in
your our output.

170
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,400
What is it mean really, it's the
probability

171
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,140
of obtaining the data you obtain given,
the,

172
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,725
the assumption the null hypothesis is
true.

173
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:34,648
Okay, it is not the flip of that, which is
what a lot of students do and actually,

174
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:40,530
even PhD's, not my colleagues here at
Princeton they wouldn't make that mistake.

175
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,420
but I've seen people do it.

176
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,880
They often get this outcome and then they
just mistakenly flip it around and say Oh,

177
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,600
well then, it's the probability of this
hypothesis given the data.

178
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,800
So the probability that the null is true
is very low.

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,010
That's not true.

180
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,740
You can't make that reverse inference.

181
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,510
So, again, this top line here is one of
the most important things I want

182
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,120
you to take away from this course, even if
you only watch this one lecture.

183
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,480
Please know that, when someone says that

184
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,410
something's statistically significant, p
less than .05

185
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:20,411
.

186
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:24,731
What it means is, it's the probability of
obtaining those data, given the

187
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,179
assumption that, there was no effect, or

188
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,970
no relationship in the study or
experiment.

189
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:39,280
So far in this course, we've only done two
procedures,

190
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,730
that we can apply NHST to.
so we've done correlation and regression.

191
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,980
We're going to apply NHST to lots and lots
of statistical procedures, going forward.

192
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,020
So far, we've only done two.

193
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,700
So when we do correlation analyses, we can
say, well, is the correlation

194
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,450
between these two variables, is it
significantly different from zero?

195
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,700
Again that's that phrase statistically
significant.

196
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,660
That's where it comes from.

197
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,620
And we could ask in a regression analysis,
is the slope of

198
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,330
the regression line for X relating to why
significantly different from zero?

199
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,540
And if so, then we would conclude and we
would

200
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,820
write up in our paper, and perhaps, the
newspaper would

201
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,400
pick it up.

202
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,750
They would say, well, researchers found a
significant correlation between,

203
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,500
a statistically significant correlation
between

204
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
working memory and intelligence, right?

205
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,290
That's, that's something that we found
before, that's a, that's a

206
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,770
significant correlation when you do the
NHST procedure and a correlational study.

207
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,600
so, so far, that's all we've, we've been
able to do with NHST.

208
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:57,180
So in the regression example I want

209
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,710
to point this out to you because you'll
see this in the lab where you start to do

210
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:08,220
multiple regression, you'll see lots of T
tests and lots of p values.

211
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,360
So it's important that you start to
understand

212
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,580
what these are because you're going to be
seeing

213
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,250
this in a lot of your R output in lab, and
as you do the next assignment.

214
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,840
So the way to get to this p value that

215
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,650
we've been talking about, is to first
calculate a t value.

216
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,730
And I'm going to cover all of this in more

217
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,370
detail, in the lecture on the central
limit theorem.

218
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,716
We'll get into the nitty gritty of these

219
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:36,613
T values and P values, and their
relationship.

220
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,690
But for now, I just want to show this to
you

221
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,340
because you're going to see it on your R
output.

222
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,400
So the T value is

223
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,230
just the regression coefficient relative
to

224
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,540
the standard error of the regression
coefficient.

225
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,110
And, it's a ratio.

226
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,770
And most NHSTs are, essentially just
ratios.

227
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,570
And they're basically, what did you
observe relative

228
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,440
to, what do you expect just due to chance?

229
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,920
Alright, that was standard error.

230
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,530
Standard error

231
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,120
was "how much sampling error are we going
to get, just due to chance?"

232
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,860
The regression coefficient is what we
actually observed.

233
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,150
So, if what we actually observed is a lot

234
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,610
stronger than what we expected due to
chance, then

235
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,310
we'll get a high T-value and that's
going to result

236
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,190
in a low P value and a statistically
significant result.

237
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,610
In contrast, if my regression

238
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,490
coefficient is the same as what I would
expect, just do to chance error.

239
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,980
So if B is equal to SE, then we have a T
of one.

240
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,630
That's not going to give me a low p value.

241
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,180
That's not going to result in a
statistically significant result.

242
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,670
we would have to retain the null
hypothesis in that case.

243
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,020
and you'll see this in the R output, and

244
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,520
we're going to cover the, the underlying
math of this

245
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,340
in much more detail when we cover multiple
regression

246
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,350
So, to summarize this segment NHST is,

247
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,880
is simply a procedure for hypothesis
testing and it's just one procedure.

248
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,600
There are other ways to engage in
hypothesis

249
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,700
testing, which I'll talk about in the next
segment.

250
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,340
and I said, I like to just think of it as
a

251
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,170
game, we're playing a game, NHST makes it
a little less controversial

252
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,160
if I think of it as a game.

253
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,810
it requires this binary decision, so you
either reject the null hypothesis,

254
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:43,450
or you retain it and what that means is,
there's always going to be

255
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:48,520
four possible outcomes, two are great
correct,correct retention, correct

256
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:55,180
rejection and two are errors, the type one
error False alarm, type two error, a miss.
