1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,010
Hi, and welcome to Statistics One.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,304
The purpose of this first lecture is, as
the

3
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:12,290
title suggests, to give you an
introduction to the course.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,020
but it's also mainly designed to introduce
you to

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,490
some terminology that's necessary to
understand the first week's lectures.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,440
As you see from the website, we did this
course last year.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,674
And one of the, one of the first points of
feedback

8
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:33,602
we got on the discussion forms was that,
although this course is designed to

9
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:36,605
be a friendly introduction for anyone who

10
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:40,611
wants to take statistics, regardless of
background.

11
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:43,026
we learned early on that we used some
basic

12
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:46,840
terms and phrases, that not everyone is
familiar with.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,809
So that's the main purpose of this, this
first lecture,

14
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,725
is to get everybody on the same page, and
to

15
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:57,289
clarify some of the terminology and
phrases that are

16
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,210
common in the first lecture and throughout
the course.

17
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:08,060
also if you have any questions about the
course, about the structure of the course.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,052
Or if you have questions about particular
phrases or definitions of terms,

19
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:18,220
you can go to the website, we have a
glossary of terms that's on the website.

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,820
Or feel free

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,280
to ask a question in the discussion
forums.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,055
So if you don't understand a phrase, if
you

23
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:27,714
don't understand a term that I used early
on.

24
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:31,818
please post a question in the discussion
forums, and either I or

25
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:36,390
my team or some other students will, will
answer it quickly, okay.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,670
So let's launch into this first
introductory lecture.

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,999
So, lets start with a basic definition

28
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:49,530
of what is statistics?
you could define it in many ways.

29
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,134
For something as broad as this, you can
just Google statistics

30
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:58,294
definition, or statistics meaning, or just
look at the Wikipedia page.

31
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:01,106
I've defined it very broadly here, just as

32
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:04,840
the scientific discipline devoted to the
study of data.

33
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,360
that of course begs the question, well
what is data?

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,768
So, let's define data.
Data simply is a

35
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:20,572
collection of numbers.
assigned as values to quantitative

36
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:26,590
variables, or characters assigned as
values to qualitative variables.

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,780
That sounds kind of lingo-y and, and,
technical, so what do I mean exactly?

38
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,030
Let's look at an example.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,090
So consider we have the academic record of
a bunch of children in elementary school.

40
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,958
And that might look something like this if
we organize it into a spreadsheet.

41
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,809
think Microsoft Excel if you're going to
be, we're going to be using our In R,

42
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:56,430
this would be called a data frame, we'll
get to that in the first lab.

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,430
Basically, its just a data structure

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,220
that has columns.
So here are the columns.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,504
And it has a bunch of rows, its very
common for one row, to

46
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:18,515
pretend to one student or one case in your
data file.

47
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:23,920
So we have a student there initials in the
first column then the agenda.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,490
This first student is TR male, there age

49
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,530
in months, so these are, as I mentioned,
Elementary,

50
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,364
Ed.

51
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:38,210
schoolchildren and then their grades in
certain classes.

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,970
So what do I mean by data?

53
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,140
Well, each one of these little points, so
like, TR's

54
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,523
really nice 95 in math is a data point.
We assigned a

55
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:57,173
value to a variable, math score for a
particular student,

56
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:02,597
that's a quantitative piece of data is
TR's name,

57
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:07,456
TR's gender, those are characters that we
assign

58
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:12,330
as values.
So those are examples of qualitative

59
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,376
data.
Another way to define data is, the

60
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:22,416
more technical, is it's the lowest level
of abstraction, from which

61
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:26,650
information and then knowledge can be
derived.

62
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,170
So at the lowest level, we have data.

63
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,810
From data, we can get to information.

64
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,930
And as we gather lots and lots of
information,

65
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,863
we can start to form a knowledge base, and
form.

66
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,580
knowledge structures and wisdom.

67
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,667
To be clear, a statistician is a

68
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:49,200
skilled person in applying the tools of
statistics.

69
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,660
so there are lots of examples of that.

70
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,960
This is not intended to be an exhaustive.
list of statisticians, just a sampling.

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,080
So, there are lots of statisticians who do
academic research.

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,360
That's, like, what, I do.

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,098
So, I'm a professor at Princeton.
I do research in cognitive psychology,

74
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:12,540
specifically in memory and attention and
intelligence.

75
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,700
And so I do academic research.

76
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,290
I apply statistical tools to do my
academic research.

77
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,995
there's lots of examples, not just in
psychology, but across the

78
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:28,260
disciplines in colleges and universities
all over the world of academic research.

79
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,068
There's lots of examples of medical
research that occurs in hospital settings.

80
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,710
there's lots of examples of survey
studies.

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:42,558
They're the most popular like poling
studies to predict election outcomes.

82
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:47,478
or like the census polls there's lots of
research that takes place

83
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,998
in the realm of education like that
academic records example.

84
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:58,157
there's lots of research in education and
online education going on right

85
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:02,745
now, trying to understand, how online
education is working.

86
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:08,440
then finally, there is a big sector that
used to be called market research, now

87
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,905
I think if falls under the phrase,

88
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:14,770
Analytics, also falls under the phrase,
Big Data.

89
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,440
A big area where statisticians are being
hired right now.

90
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,297
So again, to be clear in terminology, a
statistic is just

91
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:28,610
a quantity calculated from a sample of
data, and we're going to do this a lot.

92
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,660
We're going to get samples of data, and we
can calculate lots of statistics.

93
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,480
And I'm sure you've done this before, so
if you've been in school before.

94
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,869
You could get all of your grades and
calculate your average grade in a

95
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,026
particular subject, or your average across
all

96
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:49,627
your subjects to get your grade point
average.

97
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:54,583
so, an example in our academic records
example is

98
00:06:54,583 --> 00:07:00,160
the average math grade or average age of
students.

99
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,280
We could also calculate how much
variability there is.

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,200
We'll talk about this in the second week,
how to calculate variability in a sample.

101
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,250
one of the most popular ways to do that is
through standard deviation.

102
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,680
We can calculate standard deviation of the
math grade.

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,254
That would tell us how much variability
across

104
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:19,790
the students is there in the math grade.

105
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,498
So I just mentioned the idea of a sample
there.

106
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:27,792
so it's, it's important at the beginning

107
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:31,240
to make this distinction between sample
and population.

108
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,795
We'll often be talking about samples in
populations

109
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:39,016
so populations, I'll start at the bottom
here.

110
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:43,810
are the entire collection of cases or
people or subjects

111
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,620
I might use that phrase, which we want to
generalize to.

112
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,246
So if I want to do a study about all
healthy undergraduate students

113
00:07:54,246 --> 00:08:00,438
who were taking college courses or taking
courses online.

114
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,950
that's my population.

115
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,382
I typically can't get my hands on that

116
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:07,498
entire population to do my study, to
administer

117
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:10,614
my experiment, or administer my measures,
so I

118
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:14,000
would try and get a subset of that
population.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,870
And that's called the sample.

120
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,720
So the sample is simply a subset of the
population.

121
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,164
A statistic as I defined just a moment
ago, is

122
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:29,460
a numerical measure that describes a
characteristic of a sample.

123
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,260
Statistics hopefully are good estimates of
parameters.

124
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,950
Parameters describe populations.

125
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,399
So you have samples, populations,
statistics, parameters.

126
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,394
A basic distinction at the beginning of
any

127
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:49,317
statistics course, if you pick up any
intro

128
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:52,161
to stats textbook, most of them start with

129
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:58,080
this distinction between descriptive
statistics and inferential statistics.

130
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,570
And in fact, we'll do the same.

131
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,170
The first couple weeks of this course will
mainly deal with descriptive statistics.

132
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,502
Just how do we summarize,

133
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:10,500
organize, just simplify data?

134
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,240
How do we tell a story about what's in a
sample's worth of data?

135
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,106
We'll then move on to the more difficult
task

136
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:22,900
of inferential statistics, which is where
we'll learn procedures.

137
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,910
Where we allow for generalizations about

138
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,240
the population parameters from the sample
statistics.

139
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,520
Again, we typically can't get our

140
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,612
hands on the entire population, so we'll
look at our sample statistics and try

141
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:43,190
and make inferences about the population.
Based on those statistics.

142
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,770
That piece is called inferential
statistics.

143
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,207
Finally, I just want to give you a brief
introduction to

144
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:55,580
different research methods, and this is
really the topic of week one.

145
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,973
There's two lectures in week one, where

146
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:04,544
we'll talk about correlational and
experimental research.

147
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:08,864
it's important to know what type of
research you're

148
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:13,088
engaged in, or what type of research
others are

149
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:16,064
engaged in as you evaluate data and as

150
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:20,228
you evaluate the statistics applied to the
data.

151
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:23,868
So, the simplest type of research method
is just descriptive

152
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:28,700
research, just, describing what's in a
sample's worth of data.

153
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,430
That's just organizing, summarizing,
describing the data.

154
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,950
So, in the example of academic, the

155
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,310
the academic records of elementary school
children.

156
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,180
We already did that.

157
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,730
We organized it into a spreadsheet, we
summarized it.

158
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,022
We could just give basic descriptive
statistics, like the mean of, of the

159
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:54,170
kids in terms of age or the mean math
score, average math score.

160
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,650
That's just descriptive, describing what's
in the data.

161
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,300
Another type of method is correlational
research.

162
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,820
So we might want examine the relationship
among variables in our data structure,

163
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,320
so we might want to say, well is math
grade correlated with history grade.

164
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,190
And is history, is history grade
correlated with the science grade?

165
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,130
Or is age correlated with math grade.

166
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,708
All of those are examples of correlational
research.

167
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,250
And that's going to be the main topic of
lecture two.

168
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,950
We'll spend an entire lecture talking
about correlational research.

169
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,160
And correlational methods.

170
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,782
And finally, there's experimental
research, and experimental

171
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,442
research is sort of the gold standard, if

172
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:44,634
you want to do research that gets at
statements

173
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,349
about causaility or if you want to get at.

174
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,780
Research methods that explain

175
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,381
causal mechanisms.

176
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:57,280
so, experimental research is very popular
and very powerful, and we're actually

177
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,110
going to spend all of lecture one, talking
about experimental research methods.

178
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,516
So, an example in the context of our
elementary school children

179
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:13,660
is, we might randomly assign students to
two types of schedule.

180
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,865
So some kids might be randomly assigned to

181
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,385
learn year-round, so they don't get a
summer

182
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:22,354
break, they just get small breaks
throughout the year.

183
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:25,166
and other kids might be randomly assigned
to

184
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:29,860
a summer break, more traditional academic
calendar condition.

185
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,100
And if we randomly assign kids to those

186
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,460
con, two conditions, we could then look
at, their

187
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,190
achievement at the end of the school year,
and

188
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,886
see if their achievement was affected by
that manipulation.

189
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:47,800
So, does year round schooling work better
than the traditional academic calendar?

190
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,710
And some people have actually done
research on that.

191
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,806
My final statement in this first, the
first lecture, is I want to

192
00:12:55,806 --> 00:13:01,050
remind you that it is the Internet,
International Year of Statistics, 2013.

193
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,470
There's lots of information on this
website, statistics2013.org.

194
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,226
So there's lots of exciting happening
right now, there's,

195
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,880
as I mentioned, there's lots of jobs
opening up.

196
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,220
All around the world, especially in the
US, for people who have some

197
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,800
sort of skill in doing statistical
analysis.

198
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,076
So, you're in the right place, go, please

199
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:28,140
check out more about the international
year of statistics.

200
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,724
I just wanted to pick out one quote from
their website.

201
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,090
and it's here on this last slide.

202
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,850
Statistics is becoming more critical as
academia, businesses, and governments

203
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,386
come to rely on data driven decisions,
greatly expanding the

204
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:49,290
demand for statisticians.
So sit back, relax, enjoy Statistics One.

205
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,430
Again, if any of these terms are new to
you, if there're new phrases.

206
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,405
definitions that you need clarification
on, please check out

207
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,480
the glossary of terms on the website and
also feel

208
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,780
free to post a question of the discussion
forum, and

209
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,405
I or my team or other students will get
back

210
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:08,784
to you very quickly.

211
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:13,459
Thanks for tuning in, and I look forward
to seeing you in lecture one.

212
