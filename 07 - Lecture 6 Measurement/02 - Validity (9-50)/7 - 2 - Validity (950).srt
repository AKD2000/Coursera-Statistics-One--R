1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,260
Hi, welcome back, we're up to lecture 6,
segment 2.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,128
This lecture is all about measurement
issues.

3
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:13,330
In the first segment we talked about
reliability, in

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,679
the second segment, we're going to talk
about validity.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,400
So there's a lot to talk about when
talking about the validity of a construct.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,980
First of all we have to talk about what is
a construct?

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,970
How do we operationalize it?

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,900
That sounds like a mouthful.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,000
And then they're a lot of ways to access
validity and I'll

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,520
walk you through each one of these just
with one quick example.

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,410
there are actually entire courses on
measurement

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,170
theory that cover reliability and
validity.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,350
So to cover all of this in just one
lecture is a bit difficult.

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,860
But again, I think it's critical to expose

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,760
you to these issues in an introductory
statistics course.

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,930
So, what is a construct?
Again, I'm coming at statistics

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,770
from the social sciences, rather than say,
like from mathematics,

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,280
where they would worry less about, issues
like this.

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,940
the construct, a simple way to define it,
is it's an

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:23,060
ideal object that's not directly
observable, as opposed to real objects.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,740
So, Remember back when I talked about
variables and constants.

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,730
It's like comparing apples and gravity.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,230
[LAUGH]

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,640
apples are real objects we can measure the
size, the weight, the type and so on.

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,270
They're, they're very easy to measure.

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,520
we don't eat a construct, an abstract
construct of apple.

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,200
but in the social sciences, we do

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,880
Deal with very fuzzy and abstract
constructs all

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,960
the time, perhaps the most famous one

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,700
is intelligence; for over a 100 years
researchers

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,390
have been arguing about what intelligence
really

32
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,170
means, how should we really access it.

33
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,390
That construct intelligence Is one of the
most famous

34
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,870
and one of the most controversial, but
that's a construct.

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,595
The personality traits are also a
construct.

36
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:17,690
One of the most important things for
statistics

37
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,880
and to do empirical research is to
operationalize a construct.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,000
So, first define the construct but then
come

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,900
up of some way to quantify that construct.

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,120
So that's the process of opera,
operationalization.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,460
How do we operationalize a const, a
construct.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,090
You define it to make it observable

43
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,830
and quantifiable so, for example,
intelligence tests.

44
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,230
So we have this idea that

45
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,420
there's something called intelligence and
that came of observations

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:59,120
of children in classroom, some tended to,
to do better across the board than others.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,820
and then intelligence tests were

48
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,320
developed to operationalize that construct
intelligence.

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,570
Again there's a lot of controversy around
how that's done but

50
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,730
that's the process of defining a construct
and then operationalizing it.

51
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,160
So then we can do empirical research.
We can can data and do our statistics.

52
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,410
So how do we evaluate the validity of a
construct.

53
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,000
Turns out there are sort of four main
categories

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,130
to look at when you are looking at
construct validity.

55
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,130
First is content validity.

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,960
Then the next two sort of go hand in

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,100
hand, convergent and divergent validity,
and then finally nomological validity.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,680
So to illustrate those four types of
validity, I'm going to take a very

59
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,400
simple example that's not very
controversial

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,640
and move away from the intelligence test.

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,100
But related.

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,460
let's look at verbal ability in young
children.

63
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,600
This is a construct.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
It's a very important construct for
academic achievement.

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
as you're raising your children, you want
them to learn how to read.

66
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,070
You want them to build their vocabulary.

67
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,270
This leads to their verbal ability, a
construct

68
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,110
that cognitive psychologists And
educational psychologists

69
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,110
and developmental psychologists use quite
often.

70
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,340
So there's our construct, verbal ability.

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,230
How might we operationalize that?

72
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,810
Well, one way is just to develop a
vocabulary test.

73
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,830
We could come up with a vocabulary test,
administer it

74
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,230
to a bunch of children, and see how they
do.

75
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,250
Does it assess Their verbal ability in a
valid way.

76
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:43,120
Well, how will we determine if it's valid.
Well first, look at content validity.

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,970
Content validity is very simple.
It's just

78
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:45,970
[INAUDIBLE]

79
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,240
.
Look at the test.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,040
Does this look like It's a vocabulary test

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,150
that's appropriate for this population,
this sample of children.

82
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,430
So is it a collection of words that these

83
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,420
children should know, some of them, not
all of them.

84
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,010
We wouldn't give a vocabulary test in
German to students in Brazil.

85
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,370
Alright, that wouldn't have content
validity.

86
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,630
and we wouldn't give a vocabulary test
that's

87
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,440
appropriate for say, you know, 12 year old

88
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,630
children to four year old children because
they

89
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,720
wouldn't get any of them right most
likely.

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,920
So that would be lacking in just face
validity or content validity.

91
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,120
So that's a really simple one.

92
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,090
The next two go hand in hand, convergent
and divergent validity.

93
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,470
So the idea of convergent validity is
scores on this test,

94
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,150
however I've operationalized the construct
this

95
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,410
vocabulary test, scores on the vocabulary

96
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,640
test Should correlate well with other

97
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,780
established measures of the same
construct.

98
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,880
So, for example, if we have a measure of
reading comprehension, that

99
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,770
we know is reliable and valid and well
accepted by educators, teachers, parents.

100
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,450
And then we administer our new vocabulary
test.

101
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,860
And scores on the vocabulary test are
correlated with scores on the

102
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,240
reading comprehension test, then that
indicates

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,090
to us some level of convergent validity.

104
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,830
The scores are converging on other

105
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,450
measures of this construct, verbal
ability.

106
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,500
But it's not enough to just have
convergent validity.

107
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,310
And sadly, a lot of researchers just stop
there.

108
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,410
They try to get their convergent validity,
and then they stop.

109
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,570
What's critical is to show the flip side.

110
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,250
You gotta have divergent validity along
with your convergent validity so

111
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,425
you also have to show that your measure
of, of verbal ability.

112
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:44,510
Say, your vocabulary test.

113
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,370
You also have to show that it correlates
less well with some other ability.

114
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,300
Or correlates less well with things that
it just shouldn't correlate with.

115
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,730
Say, height, right?

116
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,480
just any, just, if, if there's any
assessment that

117
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,360
you can look at, that it should be
correlated

118
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,090
at 0 with, then you should test that, and

119
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,440
that would give you some evidence for
divergent validating.

120
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,390
So if you see a stronger correlation

121
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,590
between the vocabulary test and reading
comprehension

122
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,970
than you do between the vocabulary test

123
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,190
and some measure of spatial ability, for
example,

124
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,350
that would illustrate some divergent
validity.

125
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,280
So it's correlating with the things it
should

126
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,660
and not correlating with the things that
it shouldn't.

127
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,980
Convergent validity and divergent
validity.

128
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,790
Finally, there's nomological validity
which is

129
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,430
more like, meta validity if you will.

130
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:38,930
[LAUGH]

131
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,520
the scores on the test, say this
vocabulary test say they should be

132
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,430
consistent with more general theories that
exist in related fields of research.

133
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,010
So, for example, if we're looking at
verbal ability in children.

134
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,870
Then scores on the test should be
consistent with

135
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,930
what we know about developmental

136
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,900
psychology, cognitive psychology and
neuroscience.

137
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,500
For example

138
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,860
a child with neural damage or a disease to
a particular

139
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,050
brain region that is known to be important
for the development of

140
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,500
verbal ability Those children should score
less well on this test

141
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,990
of vocabulary if it is indeed a valid
measure of that construct.

142
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,840
That fits in with broader theories and its
consistent with convergent.

143
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,750
Evidence,

144
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,485
so it fits with normological concepts or
theories and that's why it's called

145
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:41,120
normological validity.
Sort of a broader approach to validity.

146
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,510
Again, which sadly in the realm of Social

147
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,180
Sciences is not addressed enough in in my
opinion.

148
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,870
so, I want to sum up the first two
segments

149
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,110
here, reliability and validity, because
they go hand in hand.

150
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,520
And, as I said, there are actually entire
courses devoted to measurement theory.

151
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,020
When I was a graduate student, I took an

152
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,240
entire semester course, just on
measurement and reliability and validity.

153
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,730
It's very common in cognitive psychology.

154
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,400
It's even more common in developmental
psychology, and particularly

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,660
educational psychology.

156
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,870
It's really important to know that you

157
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,970
have reliable and valid measurements and
valid constructs.

158
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,960
so the important things to take away are
this

159
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,090
broad theory of classical tests theory, or
true score theory.

160
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,760
Then the different ways to get reliability
estimates.

161
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:41,518
And then the different ways to assess
validity

162
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:50,674
of a construct.
