1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,500
Hi, and welcome back to Statistics one.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,190
We're up to lecture six and the topic of
today's lecture is Measurement.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,510
As I mentioned in lecture five, most intro
stats courses and most intro stats

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,160
textbooks don't spend too much time
talking about measurement issues.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,380
But for me, this is a really critical

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,990
issue, and I feel should be a fundamental
part

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,610
of an intro stats course.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,440
So we're going to devote an entire lecture
to just core measurement issues.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,780
So in this lecture, we're going to, we're
going to divide it up into three segments.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,430
In the first segment, I'll talk about
reliability.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,760
In the second, I'll talk about validity
and in the

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,700
third we'll revisit this idea of random
and representative sampling.

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,380
So in this first segment let's look at
reliability.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,130
The important concepts or topics to take
away

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,820
from this, are this broad theory that's
known as

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,860
classical test theory It's also known as
true

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,990
score theory, it comes out of psychology,
specifically psychometrics.

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,610
and I'll explain, just briefly what
classical test theory is about.

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,890
And then, we'll talk about how to
calculate reliability estimates.

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,660
So how do we know how reliable our
measures are.

21
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,800
To be clear, what I mean by a reliability
estimate

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,910
is just, if I use an instrument to measure
some

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,990
property one time, and then I use it
again, the,

24
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,470
the measurements from time one to time two
should be stable.

25
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,230
So just think of a scale.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,920
As you step on a scale, you weigh
yourself, you get off, you step on

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,200
it again.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,680
You should get about the same exact
weight, right?

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,620
If it's a reliable scale.

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,110
That's all we're talking about here, is,
do we have reliable measurements?

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,930
it's a little bit harder to evaluate
reliability

32
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,880
when you're dealing with things like
intelligence or personality.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,860
Or attitudes.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,860
weight and mass, those things are easier
to assess reliability.

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,670
So how do we deal with these fuzzier

36
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,080
constructs that are common in the social
sciences.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,040
That's where classical test theory comes
in.

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,300
So these raw scores I've been talking
about, that I've been

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,920
giving the letter x to, they're never
perfect in the social sciences.

40
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,870
They're influenced by bias, they might be
influenced by chance error.

41
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,070
They're influenced by all sorts of
factors, they're, they're never perfect

42
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,150
assessments of whatever construct it is
we're setting out to measure.

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,070
Even body

44
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,240
temperature which is a, a, a pretty
concrete

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,150
example, is susceptible to bias and chance
error.

46
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,090
for example, with body temperature, there

47
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,260
are different methods to assess body
temperature.

48
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,630
You can assess body temperature orally,
internally, there's this new

49
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,560
thing called an infrared thermometer wand
that you can do.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,150
Each of those give slightly different
measurements,

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,140
there could also just be random chance
error.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,230
So if I'm If I'm trying to measure body
temperature of

53
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,690
my partner, and he just took a swig of
cold water,

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,250
and I didn't know that, then I'm going to
get a cold reading.

55
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,440
And that's just random chance error.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,780
So measurement is always susceptible to
chance error.

57
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,740
It's always susceptible to er has the
potential to be susceptible to bias.

58
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,640
So here's the heart of classical test
theory is

59
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,420
in a perfect world, it would be possible
to get

60
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,630
the true score for whatever it is we're
trying to assess.

61
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,110
So it should be possible for me to get the
true body temperature.

62
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,650
But I can't, there's always going to be
just chance error.

63
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,120
There might be systematic bias.
So any raw score x is actually the true

64
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,450
score plus some bias if it exists plus
some chance error.

65
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,590
And as I said this is also known in
psychometrics as true score theory.

66
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,390
So, as a measure x, approaches the true
score, it's considered to be reliable.

67
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,680
The problem there is we don't know what
the true scores are.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
if we can't actually get th, assessments
of

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,990
the true score, then we can't judge how
far

70
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,550
we are From the true score by looking

71
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,400
at the difference between raw scores and
true scores.

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,610
So we just have to estimate reliability
and

73
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,820
there are several ways to do that and I'm
going to

74
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,170
walk you through three of them here in
this segment.

75
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:53,730
The three that'll talk about and there are
more

76
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,840
ways to do this, but I'm just going to
emphasize three.

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,130
there's one, test re-test.

78
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,040
Another is known as parallel tests.

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,640
And the third is known as inter-item
estimates.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,920
I'll walk through each of these.

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,930
For now, let's go back to this body
temperature example.

82
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,730
Forgive me if I'm harping on this one, but
it works really well for several examples.

83
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,450
Then it'll work again.

84
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,440
next week in one of the lectures, then
I'll drop it.

85
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,250
so, two more times I'm going to use body
temperature.

86
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,300
again, think of three different ways to
measure body temperature.

87
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,460
Orally, through a thermometer in your
mouth.

88
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,530
Internally, there are ways you can do
that.

89
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,700
and then, with this new wand.

90
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,250
If you're not familiar with that It looks
something like this, and

91
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,300
all you have to do is just wave it over
the forehead

92
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,290
of a patient and it will give you a
reading.

93
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,250
My partner is actually a nurse, so I'm
very familiar with this,

94
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,100
and he tells me that these tend to run a
little hot.

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,340
So they have a systematic bias, is what
he's saying.

96
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,800
They tend to give readings that are a
little

97
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,670
ab, a little higher, than say an oral
thermometer.

98
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,540
So, that's a systematic bias.

99
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,130
because, not,

100
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,230
it's not that it runs a little hot for
men, not for women.

101
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,650
Or, for people with hair, not for people
with hair.

102
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,340
It's a systematic bias, for everybody it
runs a little hot.

103
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,950
That's bias instead of chance there.

104
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,740
So let's go back and look at histograms.
So here's a histogram.

105
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,230
This is from way back in the lecture on
distributions.

106
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,240
This is a histogram

107
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,370
of body temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
It's a normal distribution.

108
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,490
If you're not used to Fahrenheit, the

109
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,106
normal average body temperature in
Fahrenheit is 98.6.

110
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:48,340
And you can see, that's, like, right
around here.

111
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,930
So this is a nice normal distribution.

112
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,930
I know, probably the majority of of

113
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,290
the students out there are more
comfortable with

114
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,700
Celsius, so I just replotted it.
And Celsius, same exact data.

115
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,180
In Celsius, normal body temperature
average is 37 and that's like right here.

116
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,840
Okay, so we have nice, normal
distributions.

117
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,320
let's assume these were measured with the
oral thermometer.

118
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,590
That tends to give distributions like
this.

119
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,490
Now let's assume that we used this
infrared

120
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,810
thermometer, that we know runs a little
high.

121
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,550
Here it is in Fahrenheit.

122
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,310
We still have a relatively normal
distribution, there's

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,660
this one guy out here, but it's pretty
normal.

124
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,520
But if you look at the scale of the X
axis, it's just shifted.

125
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:49,739
And, you see, that the average is now,
it's right about 99.5,

126
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:56,040
maybe a little higher, say 99.6, it's
almost like a degree higher.

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,220
But it's a degree higher for everyone.
That's systematic biased.

128
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,310
It's not random chance error, it's
systematic

129
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,310
biased because it's affecting the entire
distribution.

130
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,810
And again if you're more comfortable with
celsius.

131
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,580
Same exact data, just plotted in celsius.

132
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,070
And now you see the average is where

133
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,470
[INAUDIBLE]

134
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,680
the average it's like, right about here.
It's, it's approaching 38 degrees.

135
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,080
It's like, maybe 37 7.

136
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,010
So again, it's running a little hot.

137
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,940
But it's, it's running hot for the entire
distribution.

138
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,420
That's a systematic bias.

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,700
So, how do we detect these kinds of
biases, chance

140
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,250
errors, and how do we estimate the
reliability of a measure.

141
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,160
Well, the first way I'm going to describe
is the test, re-test method.

142
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,440
So, it's very simple.

143
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,620
Just like this scale example.
Just measure every one twice.

144
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,160
Let's take the oral thermometer, measure
everybody in a sample, then wait a few

145
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,630
hours, do it again, and their measurements
should be correlated.

146
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,240
Those people who are a little, have a
little bit higher body

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
temperature at time one should have the
same thing at time two.

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,150
There should be a strong correlation.

149
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:23,390
In fact, the correlation between X1 and X2
is the reliability estimate.

150
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,450
If there's no correlation between
measuring say

151
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,520
your weight on a scale the first time and
weight on a scale

152
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,220
the second time, if there's no

153
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,280
correlation, then that's a completely
unreliable scale.

154
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,700
Right, that's unreliable the correlation
zero.

155
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,450
What that means for correlational analysis
is if something correlates

156
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,410
with itself at zero, it can't possibly
correlate with anything else.

157
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,450
Right.
So the reliability estimate is

158
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,580
actually the celing.

159
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,170
For the magnitude of correlation you could
ever

160
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,660
find with some other construct or some
other measure.

161
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:06,140
So that's why it's so critical to have
strong high reliability estimates.

162
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,200
Because they limit how high your
correlations

163
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,379
can go as you do correlational studies.

164
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,380
So this test retest method.

165
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,830
We just look at the correlation between x1
and x2.

166
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,075
The pr-, the only problem with the

167
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:26,650
test/retest method is, it wouldn't detect
the bias.

168
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,590
The systematic bias in the instrument,
right?

169
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,090
So if we use the infrared meter.

170
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,930
I did that, say, on everybody in a
classroom once.

171
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,590
I did it on everybody in the classroom

172
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,130
again a couple hours later, and the
correlation

173
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,810
was really high.

174
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,720
If I only looked at the correlation, it
wouldn't tell me about the bias.

175
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,220
I would have to look at the histogram.

176
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,510
I would have to look at the mean of the
sample.

177
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,662
So so the idea of parallel tests is like

178
00:10:54,662 --> 00:11:00,619
doing the oral thermometer and the
infrared

179
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:06,737
thermometer, seeing how they're correlated

180
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:12,290
but also comparing their distributions.

181
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,760
So this would give us a reliability
estimate.

182
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,990
Again the correlation would be the
reliability estimate.

183
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,200
But comparing the means and the histograms
that would also reveal a systematic

184
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,710
biased, so that's the difference between
the test, retest and the parallel test.

185
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,220
I'm going to finally drop this body
temperature for

186
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,170
the third method.

187
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,030
and talk about inter-item estimates and
these are

188
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,448
actually the most common in the social
sciences.

189
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,630
Because tests re-tests and parallel tests
are actually hard to do.

190
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,880
when we conduct research in social
sciences

191
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,400
we're often doing research on human
subjects.

192
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,290
And that takes a lot of people's time, and
often, money.

193
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,260
so it's hard to

194
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,220
get them to say, take one assessment, and
then come back a couple weeks

195
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,980
later and just do it again, so that we can
get a reliability estimate.

196
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,830
Instead, as we try to build in a

197
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,830
reliability estimate in one meaurement And
one time point.

198
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,750
So let's go back to the idea of the,
personality surveys.

199
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,510
and assessing extraversion.

200
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,030
Suppose we had a 20 item survey tha was
designed to get at extraversion.

201
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,830
Or agreeableness or anyone of the
personality traits.

202
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,000
What's typical is we'll administer several

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
questions that get at each personality
trait.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,380
So if you remember back to the
personality, the

205
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,540
correlational studies lecture where we
talked about personality There

206
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,460
was one question that got at extraversion
that said, I'm the life of the party.

207
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,370
Strongly disagree, strongly agree.

208
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,590
And then there was another one that said,

209
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,550
I don't mind being the center of
attention.

210
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,440
Strongly disagree, strongly agree.

211
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,230
There are several like that built into the
survey, and what we can

212
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,830
do is look for correlations among those

213
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,320
items that purportedly measure the same
trait.

214
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,790
What we can do to estimate reliability

215
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,140
is just take 1/2 of the items that are
designed

216
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,510
to get at extra version and call that
subset A.

217
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,700
And then, take the other 1/2 and call that
subset B.

218
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,410
Now we have 2 assessments of extra version
built into 1.

219
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,440
Assessment.
One overall survey.

220
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,340
If they're all getting at this one
personality

221
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,370
trait, extraversion, then sub-set A should
be correlated

222
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,020
with sub-set B.

223
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,260
And that correlation will be used as the
reliability estimate.

224
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,920
It's a very common method in the social
sciences.

225
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,420
It's called inter-item estimates of
reliability.

226
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,880
So, to summarize this first segment on

227
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,090
measurement issues, the main topic here is
reliability.

228
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,300
And I introduce reliability by just giving
a quick overview

229
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,200
of this very broad theory in psychometrics
called classical test theory.

230
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,580
Or true score theory.

231
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,840
And then we talked about three ways to get

232
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,370
reliability estimates, test re-test,
parallel tests, and inter-item estimates.
