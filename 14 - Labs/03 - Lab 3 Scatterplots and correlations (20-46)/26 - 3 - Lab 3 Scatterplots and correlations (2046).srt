1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,310
Hi, and welcome to Statistics one: Lab
three.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,050
The goals for this week's lab, are, first,
we'll

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,450
read a data file into R, and print summary
statistics.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,330
Just as we did last week in lab two.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,520
But since one of the main topics this
weeks is corr-, this week, is correlation.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,975
We will run a bunch of correlation
analysis in

7
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:26,150
R and we'll examine relationships among
variables using scatter

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,970
plots and scatter plot matrices.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,490
So, you'll see for this lab that I'm using
the same data set that I used for lab two.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,250
That will keep things simple and Hopefully
this lab will

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,910
be a little shorter than last week as a
result.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,280
So again it's the example investigating
the effects of sports related concussion.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,410
using this online assessment tool called
Impact.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,500
The one change I made to the data set is I
gave the variable

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,620
name sort of Shorter labels.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,480
You'll see that comes in handy when we're
looking

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,450
at the correlation matrices, and the
scatter, scatter plot matrices.

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,560
So again, at the beginning, you should
always

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,190
make sure you, you're in the right working
directory.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,930
So you can use get WD for get your working
directory.

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,500
Or set WD for set.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,330
Your working directory.
I have all these commented out.

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,380
Because I, I have that done already.
And,

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,900
again, you might have to install some new
packages for this lab.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,630
particularly G Clus and RGL.

26
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,420
So I already did that.

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,310
I don't want to waste the time in lab to
do that.

28
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,320
But you might want to pause and install
those packages.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,090
G Clus and RGL.
Okay.

30
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,000
of course, you still need to load those
packages so, I still need to do that.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,120
I'll load the packages and

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,530
I'll read the data into a data frame
called Impact.

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,460
And, I didn't get any errors, so that
looks good.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,710
I might want to view the data or edit the
data, just to make sure it's there.

35
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,310
you can use this view function but, I

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,770
know that it doesn't work on all operating
systems.

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,140
So, try it but if it doesn't work you,

38
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,780
you can use edit, that should work in any
operating.

39
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,550
any machine, any operating system.

40
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,250
[NOISE]

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,430
So, here you see the data, it looks just
like last week,

42
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,850
we have a bunch a athletes who are in a
control condition.

43
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,360
A bump, a bunch of athletes who are in
concussed condition.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,880
We have verbal memory and this is at time
on our baseline, visual memory,

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,030
visual motor speed, reaction time, impulse
control, total symptom score.

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,850
And then, all those measures, again, at
time two or retest.

47
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,330
Again, for the

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,750
controls, that's just test retest.

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,800
So, you'll see that we can use those

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,130
as sort of est-, to get estimates of
reliability.

51
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,220
and of course, the main purpose of this
type

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,030
of research would be to look in the
concuss group.

53
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,180
And see what happens as you go from.

54
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,660
Time one baseline to the test after an
injury.

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,840
Okay.

56
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,180
So let's go back to the script.
Just as we did last week.

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,290
We could just print some summary
statistics just to make sure

58
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,500
we have the data we think we have and,
there we go.

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,610
I print, do the desrcibe function on the
impact data frame and I have

60
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,600
40 subjects or 40 athletes in this data
file and there's all my variables.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,630
And summary statistics, okay, this is sort
of we

62
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,250
covered last week, but again we will do
this probably

63
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,580
every lab just to or reinforce these,
these basic concepts.

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,510
And again we could look at the summary
statistics by conditions, so if I use the

65
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,764
function describe by the data frame impact
then impact By condition.

66
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,534
[NOISE]

67
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:48,130
Then I'll get on my summary statistics for

68
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,900
the concussed group and a control group
separately.

69
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,070
Okay, now let's get to the main topic of
this week- correlation analysis.

70
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,970
So the main function is just COR core and
what I'm doing this

71
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,470
first analysis is just Look at

72
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,180
the correlations among all the baseline
measures.

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,200
So what I'm going to put in to R

74
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,890
is cor(impact[3:8]).

75
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,840
And that's because the base line measures
are

76
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,790
in columns three to eight in the data
frame.

77
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,820
Remember, columns one and two were subject
number and condition.

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,710
So, the, the actual variables that we

79
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,520
want to correlate don't start until column
three.

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,700
So let's just do that.

81
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,790
And here we go.
We have.

82
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,640
A correlation matrix.

83
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,150
And this first number here, this shows us
the correlation

84
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,778
or little r, which we talked about in the
lecture.

85
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:51,410
between verbal memory at baseline and
visual memory at baseline.

86
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,087
So it's about.
.

87
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:52,695
38 .

88
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:56,220
it's, so it's a little bit low.

89
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,510
I, I would expect it to be a little

90
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,600
higher than that, but it's positive so
that That suggests

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,330
that verbal memory and visual memory, as

92
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,440
assessed online via Impact has some
reliability.

93
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,700
Right?

94
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,460
Because, if it didn't have any
reliability,

95
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,510
it would be able to correlate with
anything.

96
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,558
And two, it has some validity because

97
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:17,530
it's, it's showing convergence with
another memory measure.

98
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,690
Of course, could be a little better.

99
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,350
and again the sample size here is a little
low.

100
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,830
We would, we would probably want a some
more athletes,

101
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,090
but I just want to use the same data set
we used last week.

102
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,380
So let's go back to the script.

103
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,830
That correlation matrix looked a little
noisy because there's so

104
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,280
many Decimal places, so let me just use
this round function.

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,900
It's sort of standard to look at
correlations just to two

106
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,750
decimal places, so I'm just going to round
to two decimal places.

107
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,900
And now, let me bring that up a little
here's my correlation matrix.

108
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,442
Now it's a little bit easier to read.
There's that.

109
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:00,810
.
38 .

110
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,220
And, notice that visual motor speed
doesn't really correlate

111
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,990
with verbal memory, but it does with
visual memory.

112
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,650
So that makes sense cause it's visual
motor speed.

113
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,060
Also notice that it's negative.

114
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,470
And that's because this, this speed
measure

115
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,670
was measured in reaction time.

116
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,790
So, if you have better memory, you're
scoring

117
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,500
higher on the memory test, but if you're

118
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,940
faster, meaning that you're better at that
task

119
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,800
then you have a lower value cause it's
speed.

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,750
That's why there's a negative corrolation
there.

121
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,792
[BLANK_AUDIO]

122
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,510
Okay.
Now, we're going to create two subsets.

123
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,660
One for the control group, and one for the
concussed group.

124
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,280
So that we can do correlation analyses
within those groups.

125
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,950
So, again, I'm going to use the subset
function on impact.

126
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,860
And if impact if the second column.

127
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,550
If the value in there equals control I'll
set that, that athlete

128
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,920
or that row into the control data frame,
and same with concussed.

129
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,150
And there they are.

130
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,550
Okay.

131
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,550
So now let's do a correlation analysis of
the control group.

132
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,300
All of the measures, so this is both
baseline and retest.

133
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,910
So, here's this nice big correlation
matrix, it's a 12 by 12.

134
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,370
And again, one thing that I maybe should
have pointed out to you if you're new

135
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,775
to correlation matrices, the diagonal is
always going to be ones, right?

136
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:40,098
Because that's each variable correlated
with itself.

137
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:44,300
and, and this matrix every correlation
matrix

138
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,020
is symmetrical so the values below the
diagonal

139
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,260
are same as the values above the
diagonal.so here is he correlation between

140
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:59,050
verbal memory and visual memory now we are
getting nice strong positive correlation.

141
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,070
but what I mean by symmetrical is you see.

142
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,080
69 here.

143
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,480
It's also up here.

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,460
And negative 27 is here, negative 27 is
here.

145
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,130
so you only have to look really below the
diagonal to look at all the correlations.

146
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,180
But what's interesting in, in this data
frame

147
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,460
in particular is these are the control
subjects.

148
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,130
So they just perform this assessment tool.

149
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,410
At baseline and then sometime later at
retest.

150
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,280
So if we look at the correlation between
verbal memory at time one and verbal

151
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,450
memory at time two we could think of

152
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,550
that as a test, retest reliability of
precedent.

153
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,880
So it's.
67 .

154
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,980
Which is okay,

155
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,860
it's not bad.
The visual memory is a little bit better.

156
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,300
visual, visual motor speed is not as
great.

157
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,580
And then look at this one the reaction
time measure, it's remarkable.

158
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,330
It's rare that you get exactly zero.

159
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,840
The reaction time measure does not look
reliable at all.

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,830
Alright, impulse control really good.

161
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,000
And total symptom score not bad.
So these reliability estimates are for

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,850
the most part good except for this guy.

163
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,090
but remember, the, there is only 20
athletes in the

164
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:16,090
control group so there might be some
sampling error so don't,

165
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,360
I don't want to making these strong claims
about that

166
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,480
website impact based on these 20,
subjects, or 20 athletes, right.

167
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,030
this is just to illustrate the idea of
correlations and

168
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,050
the idea of tests, retests reliability.

169
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,672
So now let's look at the concussed
athletes.

170
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:38,752
Look at the concussed athletes.

171
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,040
All the measures again, I get a 12 by 12
matrix.

172
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,470
All the diagonals are ones.

173
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,430
It's symmetrical.

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,640
now we can't really think of these as test
retest reliability estimates.

175
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Because they were concussed in between.
so some of them are still high.

176
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,470
but it's hard to know you know what those
correlations mean.

177
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,410
I just wanted to run it so we could see
the same

178
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,060
thing that we saw for the control group.

179
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,670
So lets go back to the script so beyond
correlations of just the

180
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,620
main measures I thought we could do
something a little bit more then that.

181
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,470
and this will also prepare you for the
next assignment because

182
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,780
we'll ask you to do things like this in
the next assignment.

183
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,700
So let's let's propose a question Say,
does the

184
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,890
baseline impulse control of an athlete

185
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,900
predict their memory impairment after a
concussion?

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,230
So maybe athletes who are more impulsive
are going to engage

187
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,676
in a more aggressive style of play, make
themselves more susceptible.

188
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:56,950
To sort of more dangerous plays and sort
of maybe more severe concussions which

189
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,310
might then result in a worse overall
memory apparent, impairment.

190
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,440
Again, I'm, I'm sort of making this up
just for the lab.

191
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,590
so that we can do some more with the data

192
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,000
than just look at correlations along the
measures that were provided.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,230
So the first thing we need to do is

194
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,330
let's just get a composite measure of
memory impairement.

195
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,970
So we'll

196
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,720
combine verbal and visual.

197
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,880
So first what I am going to do is in the
concussed group I am going to

198
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
create a new variable called verbal impair

199
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
for verbal memory impairment, and I am
just

200
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,450
going to get that by taking their verbal

201
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,370
memory score at base line and subtracting
their

202
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:45,300
verbal memory score after an injury Then
I'll do the same thing for visual memory.

203
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,040
And then I'll combine those

204
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,470
by averaging them.

205
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,980
To get an overall measure of memory
impairment, called memory impair.

206
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,880
By adding those two impairment measures
and dividing by two.

207
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,210
That just give me the average Or composite
measure of memory impairment.

208
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,580
Then what I'll do is I'll correlate that
measure, that

209
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,740
new variable that we created, with impulse
control at timeline.

210
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,408
And let's see what happens

211
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:14,988
[SOUND]

212
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:21,252
we get a correlation of about 0.229 or
0.23 So there's

213
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:27,720
a slight positive correlation, it's not
that strong.

214
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,250
but it does look like there's some
relationship perhaps.

215
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,860
again the, the sample size is a little
small.

216
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,050
but it does suggest that those with sort
of higher scores on impulse control show

217
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,550
greater memory impairment.

218
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,970
Again, but that correlation's a little bit
low.

219
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,410
you might want to know, is

220
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,570
that correlation significant, like
statistically significant?

221
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,090
And that's exactly what we'll cover next
week.

222
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,020
So in next week's lectures you can, start
to

223
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,010
think about whether certain correlations
are statistically significant or not.

224
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,440
it depends on the sample size and it
depends

225
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,535
on the variability and you will see that
in next weeks lecture and next weeks lab.

226
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:13,380
o.k.

227
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,640
now lets go to scatterfox and this is the
way to visualize our correlations

228
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,860
or visualize relationships among variables
and I put in a note here.

229
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,630
There are a lot of scatter plot functions.
And they're in lots of different packages.

230
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,550
I tried to keep this simple, so that we
wouldn't have to download

231
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,260
too many packages.

232
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,590
but you'll see there's a lot of fun things
you can do with scatter plots.

233
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,870
And there's a lot of advanced options.

234
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,340
So feel free to explore around, and if you
find some

235
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,200
interesting things feel free to share them
in the discussion forums.

236
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,190
But let's start with the most basic plot,
it's just the plot function, and I'm just

237
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,370
going to plot verbal memory and visual
memory at

238
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,000
time one, because those showed that
positive correlation.

239
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,410
And, here's the scatter plot.
Let me make it a little bigger.

240
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,920
so here's visual memory on the x-axis, and
verbal memory on the y-axis.

241
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,560
And if you eyeball it, it looks like
overall, there's a slight positive.

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,360
Correlation.
but we can do better than eyeball it.

243
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,040
Let's put a line, on that scatter plot,
called the regression line.

244
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,330
Again, this is the topic for next week.

245
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,640
An that'll, characterize that
relationship.

246
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:37,240
Yep, I have to do the plot again.

247
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,190
There we go so now what the regression
line is and we'll talk about

248
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,570
this in detail in lecture next week and
you will do it again in lab

249
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,390
next week, what this line does is

250
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,110
it minimizes the distance between each dot
and

251
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,260
the line and that's called ordinary lease

252
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,410
squares regression which we'll get into
next week.

253
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,290
It also allows me to predict

254
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,840
scores, based, predict scores on the y
access based on scores on the x access.

255
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:19,400
So if you get a really high score of
visual memory then say around 90 here.

256
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,530
I can go up to the regression line and
then over.

257
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,990
Then I would predict you to get about you
know almost to 95 on the verbal memory.

258
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,880
task.

259
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,110
So that's what the regression line is used
for.

260
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,310
If you

261
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,380
see it like this.
This nice positive slope.

262
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,290
that means there's a positive correlation.

263
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,360
If it was completely flat, that means
there'd be a correlation of zero.

264
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,330
And if it was going the other way, a
negative slope.

265
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,160
That means there'd be a negative
correlation.

266
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,240
Okay, let's move on to scatter plot
matrices.

267
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,430
So, we have a lot of measures in this data
set, so I might want to

268
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,340
visualize all the relationships at once in
a matrix, just like

269
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,420
we did with the correlation matrix, but
now with scatter plots.

270
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,860
So let me run this.

271
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,260
And now I have what's called a scatter
plot matrix.

272
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,032
So you can see its all my measures, let me
make it a little bigger.

273
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:24,090
okay so I have verbal memory at time one,

274
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:30,290
visual memory at time one visual motor
speed, reaction time and symptoms.

275
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,640
so here's that, that one scatter plot that
we looked at between verbal verbal

276
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,880
memory and visual memory but this shows me
all of the relationships at baseline.

277
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,696
One thing to notice is down here symptom
score, why are all

278
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:49,944
these dots just sitting right on the
bottom of the graph, well that's

279
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:55,128
because it's symptom score at baseline,
most athletes are scoring zero, they're

280
00:16:55,128 --> 00:17:00,668
not showing any symptoms of a concussion
because it's baseline and they're healthy.

281
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:03,776
Okay, we can do, as I said there's a lot
of things

282
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:07,920
we could do, I'll show you one, or two
more fancy things.

283
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,200
So, I'm going to run this whole chunk of
code and then I'll walk you through it.

284
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,880
but what this will do is give us a scatter
plot matrix that's colored and it will

285
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,680
order the the variables in the scatter
plot by magnitude so lets take

286
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,640
a look, check that out, its very cool I am
going to make

287
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,450
it big, okay so again this is just a
baseline so you

288
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,910
saw that verbal memory and visual memory
those are the two strongest

289
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:44,540
ones, so puts those together with the sort
of A purple color.

290
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,610
Because that's a stronger correlation.

291
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,720
And then, symptoms is way out here on the
periphery, because it

292
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
doesn't correlate with anything at time
one.

293
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,970
because there's, there's no variance.

294
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,840
Again, if you don't have variance, you
can't get covariance.

295
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,100
Alright?

296
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,230
So that's just sort of a neat thing you
can do.

297
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,550
Again, there are many other options.

298
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,860
feel free to play with her.

299
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,450
Or search around the internet for

300
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,330
different options for scatter plot
matrices.

301
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,080
one more thing I want to do.

302
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,640
Is show you scatter plots in 3D.
So,

303
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,920
we could look at just, you know, the
relationship

304
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,210
between two variables, like verbal memory
and visual memory.

305
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,550
And.

306
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:32,700
In a two dimensional scatter plot and
that's standard, but R has lots

307
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,310
of advanced graphics so why not

308
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,050
take advantage of these three dimensional
plots.

309
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,470
So let's look at visual memory, verbal
memory and symptom score

310
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,930
all at baseline but in a three dimensional
plot And you

311
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:52,710
will see that this one is interactive, so
you see it opens up if I click

312
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:59,150
on it and hold my mouse down, then I can
move it around and we can visualize three

313
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,450
dimensional relationships, so if I hold it
just like this It looks just like the 2D

314
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,410
scatter plot we just did, so visual memory
on the X axis, verbal memory on the Y but

315
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,370
I can spin it, alright and if I spin it

316
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,170
this way, we can spin a little more what
you can

317
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,320
see is now we are going left to right here

318
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,570
You don't see any dots right their all
along the left.

319
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,820
That's because remember symptom score all
the

320
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,490
athletes are scoring around zero at
baseline.

321
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,880
So that's why I started with this one so
you can sort of get a feel for it.

322
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,560
and again what I am doing is I am just
holding down my mouse and

323
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,670
I am sort of dragging it around, so lets
just do one more and that

324
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,230
it will be the end of this lab so now lets
do this same three measures but

325
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,780
at time two so that we don't have just all
zeros for symptom score.

326
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:08,000
So now again let me just here it is that
visual memory, verbal memory in 2D.

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,560
But if I can sort of drag it around, drag
it this way,

328
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,340
now you see In this other dimension you
see there are symptom scores

329
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,400
sort of all over the place, so because
this is after concussion, so

330
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,740
its pretty cool you can play around with
that, you can add color

331
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,870
again you can add regression lines if you
like

332
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,960
so feel free to play with that more But

333
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,730
this is about all you'll need, for now to

334
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,640
understand correlations and scatter plots
and to do assignment three.

335
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,910
So, good luck on that and I will talk to
you next week in lab four.
