1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,030
Hi, welcome to Statistics One lab one.
As you can see

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,270
we're in the R console and we could type
functions into the R console

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,380
right at the command prompt.
So, I could ask R what is 1 plus 2?

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,310
And R will return the result, 3.
But you'll see the way these labs will

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,160
work, is we prefer to write our functions
and write our code in scripts.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,950
So, I'm just going to walk you through a
script in every lab.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,900
And that script will prepare you for each
week's assignment.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,360
So let me open up the script that I
prepared for

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,060
this first lab, which will prepare you for
the first homework.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,010
And the purpose of this first lab and the
goal of the first

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,430
homework is basically to just show you how
R works, its basic functions.

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,320
talk about objects R functions and what
packages are.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,870
So let's start at the top here, I'm just
going to highlight the first

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,870
few rows of code and show you that you
know R, one way

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,630
to think of R at the beginning, especially
if you're new to this,

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,270
is it's like a fancy calculator so we can
just do basic mathematical operations.

17
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,680
So I'm just going to execute

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,680
this little bit of code.
And if I now go back to the console.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,930
You'll see that R executed 3 plus 4,
giving the result of 7.

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,510
5 times 5, 25.
12 divided by 3 is 4.

21
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,890
And 5 to the fifth power is 3,125.
So we can do basic mathematical functions.

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,780
Okay?

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,000
Now we go back to the script.
A basic distinction

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,700
in R is between, what I call R objects and
R functions.

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,930
So let's look at some R objects.

26
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,910
The most basic object in R is a vector.
So, let's create a vector.

27
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm just going to exe, again, I'm just
going to execute this little bit of code.

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,870
Go back to the console.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,380
And now you see we created a vector called
v

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,850
using the c command which stands for
combine or concatenate.

31
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,950
We just combine these four numbers into a
vector and that's a numeric vector.

32
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,960
And now let's go back to the script and
now let's create a list.

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,910
A list is slightly different from a
vector.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,360
a list can contain.
Elements of different classes.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,510
So a vector has to have all of the same
class.

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,110
So that last one we created was a numeric
vector.

37
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,020
We could have created a character vector.
but now

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:42,780
I want to create a list of items, some
character strings, some integers.

39
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,185
So let's execute that.

40
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:46,840
[SOUND]

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,300
Now we create a list called l and you see
It has,

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,230
the word blue and then it has the integer
two and so on.

43
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,170
Now, we can also create matrices and we'll
be working with,

44
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,108
mainly, we'll be working with matrices, in
future assignments in future labs.

45
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:15,140
So it's important that you understand what
a matrix is and how to access.

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,200
elements in a matrix.
So let's create a matrix, call it M.

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,860
Now we have this matrix M, it's just the
integers one to six and

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,620
I gave it the dimensions, two rows and
three columns.

49
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,420
And you'll see my comment here, matrix
creation is column wise.

50
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,968
What that means is, R took the integers
one, two and

51
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:45,710
three, four it went down the columns
instead of across the rows.

52
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,200
That's what I mean by matrix creation is
column wise.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,320
Okay, back to the script.

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,950
We could also create a matrix from a
vector

55
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,010
and then add the dimensionality using the
dim function.

56
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,930
So execute that.

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,100
Back to the Console.

58
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:11,260
You see that, we created another matrix,
M2, it's the same as M, and

59
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,240
we added dimensionality just by using the
dim function, and again, that c function.

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,380
As we go forward in the, in the

61
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,320
course, we're going to be using matrices a
lot, so let me show you one more

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,450
way of.
Creating a matrix here we're

63
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,410
going to create it by binding columns and
rows so we have

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,280
x is just a vector of one to six y vector
of five

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,110
to ten.

66
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,070
And then we can use the functions cbind
and rbind.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,920
And then we have a two by six matrix.

68
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,660
Finally, you can always check the
attributes of a matrix by using.

69
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,460
A function called attributes.

70
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,048
[SOUND]

71
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:14,280
And the attributes for M, remember that
was back

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,882
up here that's just a two by three matrix.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,810
And if you want to call a particular cell
in a matrix Then, you just use the open

74
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,900
brackets and then which row and which
column you would like to access.

75
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,600
So, M open bracket one comma two, will
give me the integer three.

76
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,290
Because in my M matrix it's the first row
second column is the number three.

77
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,560
Finally let's talk about data frames.
This is what we're going to be working on.

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,720
At the beginning I said, think of R as

79
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,770
a fancy calculator where you can do
mathematical operations.

80
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,000
So, you're used to doing, probably
mathematical operations

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,840
on simple variables like we did at the

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,210
beginning, but what we'll be doing in
statistics

83
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,470
is, we'll be doing statistical analyses on
data frames.

84
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,090
It's analagous

85
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,870
to doing mathematical operations on
variables.

86
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,100
So what is a data frame, well a data
frame.

87
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,640
Is a matrix but it's a matrix that can
store different

88
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,110
classes of objects and typically what I'll
do is I'll just provide

89
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,300
you with, a data frame or data set, on the
course

90
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,330
web site and you'll just read that data
set into R using.

91
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,690
The read.table function.

92
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,700
Which is right here.

93
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,380
but in this lab, we'll just create a data
frame, so you can see what it looks like.

94
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,920
So, we can create a data frame in R.

95
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,920
There's a function called data.frame.
So let's do that.

96
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,210
So we created a data frame using the
data.frame, function.

97
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,140
And I called it d.

98
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,910
And then I just printed it by typing d

99
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,780
at the command prompt, or actually it's in
the script.

100
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,350
and there's the data frame.

101
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:28,050
You can ask R how many rows are in your
data frame, how many columns, again,

102
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,760
you could check the attributes, again, you
could

103
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,860
call a particular cell in the data frame.

104
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,210
So let's do all of those in one step since
we didn't, did most of this with matrices.

105
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,420
[NOISE]

106
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,140
Okay, so we ask number of rows with the n
row function,

107
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,540
there are five, we ask number of columns
with the n columns function.

108
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,620
There are three.

109
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:57,640
We check the attributes, it gives us the
names of the variables, or column headers.

110
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,820
It gives us the row names, and it gives us
the class.

111
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,770
this is a data frame.

112
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,530
And then we called particular cells in the
data frame, again, the same way

113
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,910
we did when we were looking at matrices
because a data frame is just a fancy

114
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,260
matrix, and this is what we're going to
work with mostly in future labs.

115
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,299
We can also, whoops, don't want to move my
code.

116
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,730
we can also display up a data frame and

117
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,440
edit a data frame with the view and edit
functions.

118
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,110
I'm not actually not going to run those
because

119
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,870
I want to move down to the last piece

120
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,840
Also you can get help on a function just
by typing in question function name.

121
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,580
So anytime you want to ask R what does
this function do?

122
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,276
Like if you want to know what the Edit
function does, just type in?

123
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:57,776
Edit .

124
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,980
Finally, an important thing that you, that
we all need to do before

125
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,020
the next lab and the next assignment, is
you need to know how install

126
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,800
packages, because R consists of lots and
lots of packages.

127
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,050
And a package Just is a bunch of functions
that people have created.

128
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,970
And there are lots of them.

129
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,820
If you go the R home page you can see
there are lots and lots of packages.

130
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,020
One that we'll work with in the beginning
is called Psych.

131
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,990
So, install the Psych package.

132
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,198
By typing in the function install dot
packages and then putting psych

133
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,690
in parenthesis and in quotes.
Let's do that.

134
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,760
And, you'll see what R does is it asks you
to select a CRAN mirror.

135
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,540
CRAN just stands for comprehensive R
archive network.

136
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,310
And you just have to pick a location
that's close to you.

137
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,360
so I'm going to pick Maryland, there
actually isn't

138
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,610
a New Jersey one, I'm in New Jersey.

139
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,170
but Maryland's close, so, I'll pick that.

140
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,880
This may take a second.

141
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:15,080
Oh, it's there, so now, after you've
installed the site package, you have to

142
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,820
load the package and you just do that with
the library command, so just libraries.

143
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,860
Let's go back to the console, it doesn't
return anything so let me just make sure

144
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,010
that it's there.
To make sure, I can just type search and

145
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:39,340
at the R command, prompt and then look
through

146
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,750
my output from search and I should see.
That I have the site package, yep,

147
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,870
there it is.

148
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,360
Okay, so now I've installed the site
package, that has a bunch of

149
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,980
functions that we're going to use,
especially in the first couple of weeks.

150
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,430
Throughout the, the, this course, we'll
download

151
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,630
and install lots of packages but for now.

152
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,040
all we need is the site package and the
basic packages that come with

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,380
the initial install and download of R like
stats and graphics and so on.

154
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,800
So that's

155
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,000
it, that's all you'll need to complete the
first assignment.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,910
So, I'm going to end this first lab and
I'm going to quit out of R.

157
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,470
And I can do that several ways.

158
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,908
I'm just going to go up to, the R, menu,
and quit R.

159
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:33,520
It will of-, it will ask you if you
want to save changes.

160
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,230
I actually made a couple changes to my
script.

161
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,900
So I'm going to

162
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,690
save that.

163
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,060
It will also ask you if you want to save
your workspace image.

164
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,100
This is everything that came up in the R
console.

165
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,960
Since I saved the script, I don't need to
save that and I rarely ever do.

166
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,810
So I'm not going to save that.
And that's the end of Lab One.

167
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,450
See you next week.
