Everyone in the state of Louisiana knows about the Bayou Corne sinkhole.
It even shows up on Google Maps.
But it still took a year for the crisis to get national attention, by which time the pit of brackish water was 24 acres across.
And when the nation finally turned its eye on Bayou Corne, it wasn’t because of the Mother Jones expose.
It was because of a YouTube video.

The video, “8/21/13 Slough in,” opens on a copse of hulking cedars at the edge of what appears to be a calm lake.
Suddenly, voices in the background shout, “They’re moving!” as a dozen trees glide downward in unison, their tops shaking and quivering as they’re sucked beneath the surface.
Soon, the water is still again.

The video was posted everywhere from CBS to Gawker, and now has 6.7 million views.
Reporters from CNN, Al Jazeera, and The New York Times headed to Bayou Corne, the unincorporated fishing town next to the sinkhole.

John Boudreaux, the local official coordinating the containment of the sinkhole and the accompanying methane gas leaks, is the one who shot the video.
He’s hoping all the attention will inspire help from the federal government, but that hasn’t happened yet.

Waiting has become a theme in Bayou Corne.

“My estimate for just gas removal is three to five years from now, and we’ve been in this event for a year,” says Boudreaux, who’s been at the site every day by 8AM since the sinkhole showed up.
“It’s quite frustrating, the amount of time it’s taken to get things accomplished.”
